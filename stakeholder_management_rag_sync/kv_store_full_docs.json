west-north-west off the Burrup \nPeninsula and is part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields which are estimated to hold 9.2 Tcf (2C, \n100%) of dry gas.  Woodside is proposing to develop the Scarborough gas resource through new \noffshore facilities connected by an approximately 430 km pipeline onshore. The proposal is to \ninitially develop the Scarborough gas field with wells, tied back to a semi-submersible floating \nproduction unit (FPU) moored in 900 m of water close to the Scarborough field. This report has \nbeen developed in support of environmental approvals associated with the Scarborough Project.  \nThis report is a summary of relevant information on benthic habitats from the offshore slope and \ndeeper development area and is based on survey work previously completed in the permit area \n(>950 m water depth), on the escarpment of the continental shelf (300-950m water depth) and on \nthe shelf (<300 m water depth). The data used in the assessment is based on video recordings and \nstill images collected from ROV footage obtained during industry operations at a range of \nlocations from the offshore project area as well as project specific surveys for the Scarborough \nDevelopment. \nRegional and site specific studies reviewed indicate that seabed material along the proposed \ntrunkline alignment (and around the gas field) is predominantly flat and featureless and comprises \nthick, unconsolidated fine grained sands. The sediments support soft sediment benthic \ncommunities dominated by infauna (including molluscs, crustaceans and worms) and isolated \nlarger fauna (free swimming cnidarian, demersal fish and benthic crustaceans).  \nSedimentary infauna associated with soft unconsolidated sediments of the general area is \nwidespread and well represented throughout the North West Shelf (NWS) region. In the context of \nthe broader extent of habitats across the region, benthic habitat along the proposed trunkline \ncorridor and within the Scarborough field consists primarily of soft unconsolidated sediments and \nis considered to be of relatively low environmental sensitivity. \nBenthic communities of filter feeders generally live in areas that have strong currents and hard \nsubstratum and are closely associated with substrate type, with areas of hard substrate typically \nsupporting more diverse epibenthic communities.  The only natural habitat within the offshore \npermit area and trunkline corridor that is not classified as soft sediment is the pinnacle field that \nlies in about 300m water depth, on the continental slope. The pinnacle field covers an area that is \nless than 3 km2 in size and at its closest point is more than 350m away from the proposed \ntrunkline. Furthermore,  the pinnacles are isolated forms and do not constitute continuous reef. It \nremains unclear what the rock pinnacles are constructed from, however the structures provide \nhabitat for a diverse range of epifaunal and demersal species that commonly occur elsewhere in \nthe NWS.  \nInterestingly, the habitats containing the greatest biodiversity in these offshore environments are \nthe habitats formed by colonising invertebrates on oil and gas subsea infrastructure including the \nwell heads and pipelines.  These habitats and the species present on these structures in the NWS of \nWestern Australia have been recently subject to detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment \n--- Page 8 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n(McLean et al. (2018), McLean et al. (2017), Bond et al (2018)). These habitats not only have \nstructural complexity but also create habitat for a large diversity of fish species that commonly \noccur elsewhere in the NWS but do not occur over soft unconsolidated sediments.   \n \n--- Page 9 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \nIntroduction \n1.1 \nBackground \nThe Scarborough gas resource is located approximately 375 km west-north-west off the Burrup \nPeninsula and is part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields which are estimated to hold 9.2 Tcf (2C, \n100%) of dry gas.  Woodside is proposing to develop the Scarborough gas resource through new \noffshore facilities connected by an approximately 430 km pipeline onshore. The proposal is to \ninitially develop the Scarborough gas field with wells, tied back to a semi-submersible floating \nproduction unit (FPU) moored in 900 m of water close to the Scarborough field.  \nWEL engaged Advisian to undertake an offshore marine habitat assessment to further the \nunderstanding of the environmental conditions of permit area WA-1-R. Findings from the marine \nstudies will support the Scarborough Project environmental approvals. \nThe report is a summary of relevant information on benthic habitats from the offshore slope and \ndeeper development area and is based on survey work previously completed in the permit area \n(>950 m water depth), on the escarpment of the continental shelf (300-950m water depth) and on \nthe shelf (<300 m water depth). \n1.2 \nScope of Work \nThe objectives of the offshore marine habitat assessment were: \n \nTo provide sufficiently detailed background information to enable the existing benthic habitat \nto be adequately described, particularly for benthic species and habitats of conservation \nsignificance, and \n \nTo assess and interpret the available benthic habitat data which will be used to inform \nenvironmental approvals documentation for the Scarborough Development. \n \n \n--- Page 10 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n2 \nMethod of Assessment \n2.1 \nReview of Existing Literature \nThe offshore marine habitat assessment was undertaken by reviewing relevant literature from the \nareas of interest.  This includes use of site specific environmental survey data that were \ncommissioned to investigate the environmental conditions at both the Scarborough and Pluto field \ndevelopments. Additional information was sourced from geophysical investigations, ROV surveys \nand sub-sea infrastructure inspections in the areas of interest. \nAn environmental characterisation report based on seasonal marine surveys was undertaken within \nPermit Area WA-1-R by ERM (2013).  The surveys were completed in November 2012 (wet season) \nand July/August 2013 (dry season) and included sampling of water, sediment, plankton and \ninfauna communities. Characterisation of seabed habitat was undertaken using multibeam. \nThe offshore marine environmental survey for the Pluto LNG development (SKM 2006) was also \nreviewed as the trunkline alignment from Scarborough will follow a similar route as that taken by \nthe Pluto gas trunkline.  The Pluto survey included infauna and epifauna sampling, sediment \nsampling for particle size analysis and sediment chemistry, ROV / video investigations of benthic \nhabitats and anecdotal recordings of seabirds, cetaceans and other marine mammals, sea turtles \nand other reptiles.  Detailed AUV and ROV survey data for Pluto were also reviewed as part of a \ncomprehensive geophysical and geotechnical survey of the Pluto field (Geoconsult 2005). \nThe historical marine survey work was supplemented by a series of more recent marine surveys, \nincluding geophysical and ROV surveys that filmed the proposed trunkline route through the \nScarborough field.  These include the ROV survey of the export pipeline route (Ocean Affinity, July \n2018) along a section of the continental slope between Scarborough and Pluto. \n2.2 \nReport Layout \nFor the purpose of this report, the offshore marine habitat assessment has been divided into three \nsections according to water depth. These include describing habitats in the: \n \nDeeper Water (>950m depth), which includes the seabed where the Scarborough gas field is \nlocated; \n \nContinental Slope (300-950m water depth), which includes the section of seabed between the \nScarborough gas field and the Pluto tieback; \n \nContinental Shelf (<300m water depth), which covers the seabed around the Pluto platform  \nFor the purpose of this report, survey scopes that involved water quality, plankton and other \nsurveys of the open water environment are not included in this report.  \n \n--- Page 11 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n3 \nDeepwater Habitat \nMuch of the following section has been adapted from the Scarborough marine studies completed \nby ERM in 2013. \n3.1 \nBackground \nThe Scarborough Development is located on the Exmouth Plateau, within the North-west Marine \nBioregion (Figure 3-1), as defined by DoE’s framework for coordinating conservation and \nsustainable management (DoE 2013). The region comprises Commonwealth waters from the \nWestern Australian/ Northern Territory border to Kalbarri, south of Shark Bay and covers 1.07 \nmillion square kilometres (km2) of tropical and sub-tropical waters (DEWHA 2008). The Exmouth \nPlateau is located within the region’s Northwest Province, which covers an area of 178,651 km2 and \nis situated entirely on the continental slope (DEWHA 2008). The water depths of the North-west \nProvince predominantly range between 1,000 m and 3,000 m reaching a maximum depth of 5,170 \nm. \n \nThe Exmouth Plateau, a deepwater plateau adjacent to the continental slope, is a dominant \ngeomorphic feature of the region Figure 3-2. The Montebello Trough along the south-east edge of \n--- Page 12 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nthe plateau drains into the Cape Range Canyon, while the northern portion of the plateau \ncomprises the Dampier Ridge and Swan Canyon. The Exmouth Plateau peaks at approximately \n1,000 m deep with a narrow, steep southern slope and a wider, less steep northern slope. WA-1-R \nis located in the north-central section of the Exmouth Plateau in water depths of approximately \n900 m to 970 m. \n \n3.1.1 \nSeabed Characteristics \nThe region comprises bio-clastic, calcareous and organogenic sediments deposited from relatively \nslow and uniform sedimentation rates (Carrigy and Fairbridge 1954 in Baker et al. 2008 and Jones \n1971 in Baker et al. 2008). \nSediments vary from sands and gravels on the shelf, to muds on the slope and abyssal plain/deep \nocean floor (Baker et al. 2008). Calcium carbonate deposits are located on the inner shelf, middle \nshelf and outer shelf/ slope. The Exmouth Plateau is characterised by a thick Triassic sequence \noverlain by a Jurassic, Cretaceous and Cainozoic sediment sequence; and fine-grained carbonate \nooze (Fugro 2010).  \nSediment transport at WA-1-R on the outer shelf/ slope of the Exmouth Plateau is influenced by a \ncombination of slope processes and large ocean currents. \nThe seafloor is generally flat and uniform with water depths ranging from 900 m to 970 m, with a \ngradual increase from the north/north-west to the south/ south-east of the area (Figure 2.4; Fugro \n2010). To the south-west of WA-1-R, craters (up to 400 m across and depth of up to 10 m) and \n--- Page 13 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nsmaller pockmarks (metres to tens of metres across) have been identified through geophysical \nsurveys (Fugro 2010). The seafloor exhibits gradients less than 1 degree (°) but extends to \napproximately 15 ° on the edge of craters (Fugro 2010). These crater and pockmark formations in \nWA-1-R may be associated with hydrocarbon seeps as well associated authigenic carbonate \nformations (Fugro 2010), and were a particular focus of the studies completed by ERM. \n3.1.2 \nBenthic Communities \nStudies completed within the region indicate that benthic composition in deepwater habitats is \ngenerally lower in abundance than shallow water habitats (DEWHA 2008, Brewer et al. 2007). Gage \n(1996) reported that the density of benthic fauna tends to be lower in deepwater sediments (>200 \nm) than in shallower coastal sediments, but the diversity of communities may be similar. \nInformation exists on the benthic communities of the Exmouth Plateau, although macrofaunal \nspecies diversity has been shown to be positively correlated to sediment diversity (Etter & Grassle, \n1992). The mostly fine sediment environment of the Exmouth Plateau is expected to support \nscavengers, benthic filter feeders and epifauna, particularly at the intersection with the continental \nmargin (Brewer et al. 2007). This soft bottom habitat is also likely to support patchy distributions of \nmobile epibenthos, such as sea cucumbers, ophiuroids, echinoderms, polychaetes and sea-pens \n(DEWHA 2008). \n3.1.3 \nHydrocarbon Seep-Associated Benthic Communities \nHydrocarbon seeps are the seeping of gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons (including oil and methane) \nto the surface of the seabed from fractures and fissures in the underlying rock, resulting in possible \nhydrocarbons and other chemicals in the water column (DEWHA 2008). It is possible that these \nformations may host thiotrophic (sulphur based metabolism) or methanotrophic (methane based \nmetabolism) benthic communities and chemosymbiotic benthic fauna reliant on methane-oxidising \nbacteria, which usually aggregate in the form of mats over the seafloor (Barry et al. 1996). \nThese naturally occurring seeps are known to be present in the region, with an estimated 3,300 \ntonnes seepage of hydrocarbons annually (Fandry et al. 2006). Active hydrocarbon seeps have not \nbeen identified in WA-1-R. However, geophysical surveys conducted in 2010 identified crater and \npockmark formations in WA-1-R, which may be associated with current or historic hydrocarbon \nseeps as well associated authigenic carbonate formations (Fugro 2010). \n3.2 \nSurvey Methods \nThe ERM marine investigation included sampling at 15 sampling sites as shown Figure 3-3 to: \n \nprovide a broad characterisation of the habitats within WA-1-R; \n \nachieve spatial coverage across WA-1-R; and \n \nprovide a representative selection of the various topographic features and corresponding \nbenthic habitats (i.e. crater/pockmark versus non-crater areas). \n--- Page 14 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 15 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n3.2.1 \nCamera Study (Benthic Communities) \nAt each site, the camera was lowered to the seafloor of each sampling station. The vessel then \ndrifted as slowly as possible across the station target area, capturing video footage. Video footage \nwas collected for approximately 15 minutes at each of the three stations (45 minutes of footage \nper sampling site), with footage reviewed in real time. Video footage was acquired at all sites with \nthe exception of Site 15 Stations 2 and 3 (due to bad weather). \nAdditionally, approximately 25 still images were captured opportunistically at each station sampled \n(75 images per sampling site). A total of 1,120 images were collected. \n3.2.2 \nInfauna Study \nSeafloor sediment was collected for physico-chemical analyses and identification of infauna. \nSampling was undertaken using a box corer of the following dimensions: 0.49 x 0.52 x 0.55 m \n(length x width x height). The box corer was lowered to the seafloor for collection and recovered to \nthe deck for inspection. The sample was split into quarters whereby one quarter was used for \nphysicochemical subsamples and the other full quarters were sieved through a 0.5 mm mesh sieve. \n3.3 \nResults \n3.3.1 \nBenthic Communities \nA total of 865 still images were quantitatively assessed by the South Australian Research and \nDevelopment Institute (SARDI).  A review of the benthic camera study recordings indicated a soft \nsediment seafloor across the area surveyed. \nThe quantitative assessment identified a total of 79 benthic taxa, consisting of the following phyla: \nechinoderms (28%), arthropods (24%), chordates (20%), cnidarians (19%), molluscs (4%) and \nporiferans (3%). In addition, there were 2% of taxa that appeared to be large protists (kingdom \nChromista). Organisms were identified to the lowest recognisable taxonomic unit including species \n(5), genus (12), family (13), order (18), class (26), phylum (3) and kingdom (2). \nThe five species identified comprised a crab (Eplumula cf. australiensis;), sea urchin (Phormosoma \ncf. placenta), skate (Insentiraja subtilispinosa) and two fish species (Bathypterois cf guentheri and \nBathysaurus ferox). Overall, a total of 605 individuals (including 54 unidentifiable organisms) were \ncounted, dominated by arthropods (54.70%), followed by echinoderms (16.36%), cnidarians \n(10.41%), unidentified organisms (8.94%), chordates (7.44%), molluscs (0.99%), poriferans (0.83%) \nand the kingdom Chromista (0.33%).  \nThe most abundant species were two shrimp species, of the genus Nematocarcinus. The next most \nabundant species were the gorgonian coral Metallogorgia sp. 1 (35 individuals) and the basket star \nGorgonocephalid sp. 1 (29 individuals).  Motile taxa such as shrimp, sea cucumbers and fish \ndominated the benthic fauna, comprising 75% of the species richness and 87% of the species. \n--- Page 16 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nSessile taxa such as sea pens, corals, sponges, anemones and stalked crinoids made up the \nremainder of the contribution to overall species richness and abundance (25% and 13%, \nrespectively). \nThe ERM (2013) study also noted bioturbation of the seabed in many of the images although most \ntraces could not be confidently assigned to contributing taxa.  Those that could be identified were \nconsidered potentially representative of echinoderms as well as biotic groups not identified in the \nstill imagery such as foraminiferans, echiurans and annelids.  \nBivalve shell debris was also recorded at several sites and was believed to be comprised of at least \ntwo species of the Vesicomyidae family.  Aggregations of lithodid crabs were present in one \noccurrence of shell debris within one station.  Small-scale bacterial mats that appear similar typical \nof Beggiatoa sp. were observed in a few of these bivalve shell debris occurrences. Shell debris and \nbacterial mats had mean percentage covers of 3.8% and 0.4%, respectively, across all the sites. For \nsites located in areas of coalescing seafloor craters, shell debris and bacterial mats had mean \npercentage covers of 6.3% and 0.7%, respectively. \n3.3.2 \nInfauna \nA total of 281 individuals and 43 different species were identified from the seven sediment samples \ncollected from Sites 5, 8, and 14.  \nOf the 43-species identified, 33 were identified to family level, with the remainder identified to \nhigher taxonomic levels. Crustaceans and polychaete worms were the dominant taxonomic groups, \naccounting for 89% and 86% of the individuals and species richness, respectively. The majority of \ncrustaceans identified belonged to the Leptocheliidae and Apseudoidae families. The majority of \npolychaetes identified belonged to the Pilargidae family. Holothureans, molluscs, sponges, \nsipunculids and octocorals were recorded in relatively low abundances. The average density of \ninfauna was estimated to be 214.1/m2 (±43.3). \n3.4 \nDiscussion \nNo organisms identified to species level for the studies were listed as Threatened or Migratory \nunder the EPBC Act according to the Species Profile and Threats (SPRAT) database (ERM 2013). \nBenthic camera and sediment results indicated that the seafloor around the Scarborough \nDevelopment is characterised by sparse marine life dominated by motile organisms. Such motile \norganisms included shrimp, sea cucumbers, demersal fish and small, burrowing worms and \ncrustaceans (Figure 3-4, Figure 3-5 and Figure 3-6).  Although these images were obtained from \nthe original Pluto survey (Geoconsult 2005) and are closer to the Pluto slope, they are \nrepresentative images of the deepwater habitat present at ~1,000m depth.  The observed \ndominance by motile taxa is typical of deepwater soft substrates (DEWHA 2008), with sessile taxa \nmore common on harder substrates (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2010). Overall, observations made are \nrepresentative of tropical deepwater soft sediment habitats reported in the region (BHP Billiton \n2004; Woodside 2005; Woodside 2006; Brewer et al. 2007; RPS 2011; Apache 2013; Woodside \n2013). \n--- Page 17 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 18 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nThe majority of the 15 taxa that were identified to species or genus level in the benthic camera \nstudy are distributed worldwide. It is thought that offshore deepwater habitats of the NWS tend to \nsupport widespread Indo-pacific species, retaining extensive genetic connections over large \ndistances (Heyward et al. 2006). \nFour taxa were classified as Indo-pacific species, namely the carrier crab Eplumula cf. australiensis \n(typically in waters off southern Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia (Poore 2004)), the \nvelvet skate Insentiraja subtilispinosa (only in waters off north-west Australia and the Western \nCentral Pacific (Last and Stevens 2009, Froese and Pauly 2011)), the halosaur fish Aldrovandia sp. 1 \n(previously recorded in the North West Province (Sorokin and Brock 2013)) and the tribute \nspiderfish Bathypterois cf. guentheri (Indo- West Pacific to the north east Indian Ocean and \nsouthern Japan (Froese and Pauly 2011)).  \nThe demersal fish observed potentially reflects the community near the Exmouth Plateau. The \nupper and middle parts of the continental slope in the North-west Province have a high number of \ndemersal fish species with high endemism (DEWHA 2008). This is especially so in the area between \nthe North West Cape and the Montebello Trough (along the south-east edge of the plateau, Figure \n2.1), which supports over 508 fish species of which 76 are endemic. It is noted that the demersal \nfish species identified for the benthic camera study did not correlate with the ichthyoplankton \nspecies identified in the zooplankton samples. This is attributed to the large depths at WA-1-R and \ngeneral lack of vertical mixing between the surface and deeper layers (Sundby 1996). \nThe dominant types of epifauna were arthropods and echinoderms (especially shrimp and sea \ncucumbers, respectively), while the dominant infauna groups were crustaceans and polychaetes. \nBenthic community composition was generally similar across sampling sites. There was not a \nstrong correlation between bathymetric features and sessile or motile organisms. However, \nbathymetric features may have played a role in the abundance of certain organisms. The majority \nof sites where soft coral was identified were found outside of the coalescing seafloor crater areas. \nMore than double the number of sea fans was identified in noncrater areas as opposed to \ncoalescing seafloor craters. \nThe ERM (2013) study also noted that potential indicators of historic or localised ephemeral \nhydrocarbon seep activity were the most noticeable exception to a uniform benthic composition \nacross WA-1-R. These indicators were in the form of bivalve shell debris and bacterial mats and \nthey were only identified across the sites in the seafloor crater areas, where hydrocarbon seeps \nwere considered to be potentially present (Fugro 2010). The shell debris and bacterial mats had \nlow mean percentage covers of 6.3 % and 0.7 %, respectively, across the seafloor crater sites. The \nshell debris is considered to comprise at least two species of the Vesicomyidae family, which are \ncommon components of communities of sulphide-rich reducing environments such as \nhydrocarbon seeps (Krylova and Sahling 2010). \n3.5 \nSummary \nThe low energy, soft bottom seafloor around the Scarborough Offshore Project Area supports \nsparse marine fauna as reported for the Exmouth Plateau. Sediments are calcareous, fine-grained \n--- Page 19 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nand low in nutrients. Benthic communities are dominated by motile organisms, including shrimp, \nsea cucumbers, demersal fish and small, burrowing worms and crustaceans. No threatened \nspecies/ecological communities or migratory species were identified in the studies (as defined \nunder the EPBC Act). \n \n \n--- Page 20 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n4 \nContinental Slope \nMuch of the following section has been adapted from the offshore marine environmental survey \nfor the Pluto LNG development (SKM 2006) and supporting investigations such as the Pluto \nAUV/ROV survey conducted by Geoconsult (2005) and most recently by the ROV survey completed \nby the Ocean Affinity (2018). \n4.1 \nBackground \nThe Pluto field is located on the continental slope of the NWS, where the slope is at its narrowest. \nAssessment of geophysical and ROV data confirmed that the Pluto field is traversed by several \ncanyon systems as shown in Figure 4-1. The work area was located more than 200 km NW of \nDampier off the NW coast of Australia and covered approximately 311 km2 in water depths ranging \nfrom approximately 160m to 1220m. \n \nThe Geoconsult (2005) report divides the Continental Slope into three sub-divisions, namely: \n \nDendritic channel areas \n \nChannel areas \n \nContinental slope areas (between channels) \nA total of six major and nine minor dendritic channel areas were recorded that are up to 200m \ndeep and with gradients of 1:1. Major channels were well spaced through the site: in 300m to \n750m water depth: between 500m to 1500m wide and up to 5km in length. The minor channels are \nprevalent in the southern half of the site: in 320m to 550m water depths: 500m to 900m wide and \nContinental Shelf \nContinental Slope \nAbyssal Plain \n--- Page 21 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nup to 2.4km in length. They are formed by the gradual erosion of the Continental Slope as \nnumerous small, localised slumps, which trigger turbidity currents.  It is suspected that dendritic \nchannel areas act as a focus for seafloor currents. Sediments expected to comprise very soft sandy \nclay/silt. \nSix major and nine minor complete channels were identified.  Ten channels discharge sediment \ninto the deeper water with the remaining minor channels discharging varying amounts of sediment \non to the Continental Slope. Generally, they are between 15m and 300m wide, 5m to 150m deep \nwith sidewall gradients of 1:1. The channels and their dendritic roots gradually erode the upper \nslope and transfer sediment to deeper water. Sediment is transported as local slumps and \nsediment flows and also as more extensive turbidity currents, which erode channel sidewalls and \nfloors. Layered sediments in the base of channels document deposition following sediment flows. \nPlunge pools up to 230m wide and 20m deep have been observed. Channel sidewalls are \nsusceptible to slumping and erosion. \nThe presence of sand in the channels has been confirmed by drop cores. Within the channel base \ncurrent driven bedforms or erosive “back stepping” of bedding planes was observed. ROV stills \nshow current driven bedforms and rounded cobble sized clasts and sediment clumps in the \nchannel base. Channels are not only developed by seafloor currents but have in the past been \nconduits for large scale turbidity currents. Present day sedimentary processes are observed to be \nsignificant, with active seafloor currents. \nThe Continental Slope Area (between channels) undulates and deepens from the SE to the NW \nover a series of linear and steep scarps from water depths of ~250m to 1100m. \n4.2 \nSurvey Methods \n4.2.1 \nSKM (2006) survey \nThe sampling programme was designed to collect representative biota across the outer shelf and \nslope habitats, to characterise species and habitat composition along a depth gradient down the \nslope (150 m, 200 m, 400 m, 600 m, 800 m and 1000 m). Sampling was conducted along two depth \ngradient transects, one transect orientate directly down a canyon system (referred to as canyon \ntransect) and the second transect orientated down the continental slope outside of the canyon \nsystems (referred to as slope transect). \nThe bathymetry of the canyon systems transecting the Pluto field include some very steep \ngradients, which suggests that the canyon systems could potentially contain some exposed hard \nsubstrate or cliff like structures. Surveys for the Vincent and Enfield fields, located near North West \nCape, discovered rich and diverse epifaunal communities located on several rock outcroppings in \n350–600 m water depth (Heyward and Rees 2001a and b; Heyward et al. 2001a and 2001b). In the \nabsence of targeted geotechnical and geophysical data, the sampling strategy was focused on the \nseabed with the steepest gradients in the canyon systems. A total of twenty-eight sled tows were \nsuccessfully completed by SKM (2006) across depths between 150 m and 800 m. \n--- Page 22 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nOver 40 hours of video of the seabed were collected by the ROV from depths ranging between 250 \nand 1050 m. While the majority of the seabed was composed of soft sediments, extensive video \nrecording was collected of the steep cliffs located just below 1000 m and isolated pinnacles in the \n300 m depth range. \n4.2.2 \nOcean Affinity (2018) survey \nThe purpose of this operation was to use a KD31 ROV to visually inspect points of interest (POI) \nalong the base case route slope region that were identified during the geophysical survey and to \nrevisit POI1 that was previously surveyed during the SKM (2006) ROV survey. The POI locations \nwere identified following review of side scan sonar (SSS) and multi bean echo sounder (MBE) data \ncollected during autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys as shown in Table 4-1.   \nPOI \nEasting \nNorthing \nDepth (m) \n1 \n310308 \n7798411 \n303 \n2 \n308721 \n7799862 \n454 \n3 \n309089 \n7800880 \n490 \n4 \n309498 \n7800578 \n422 \n5 \n309736 \n7800316 \n390 \n6 \n310145 \n7802325 \n450 \n7 \n311170.0 \n7796744 \n259 \n4.3 \nResults \n4.3.1 \nInfauna \nThe infauna of the continental slope, (as based on data collected from the Pluto field) was very \nsparse with a maximum density of 167 individuals/m2 from a sample collected in 400 m. Infauna \nwas generally more abundant in sites located in shallow water, although this trend with depth was \nsomewhat obscured because three samples contained no infauna, both samples from 800 m and \none sample from 1000 m. A total of 47 individuals, representing 32 nominal species, were collected \nfrom the 12 samples. The fauna was dominated by polychaetes, which comprised 79% of the fauna \nby abundance and 75% of the fauna by species richness. Some crustaceans, sipunculids and \nnemerteans were also recorded but no molluscs or echinoderms were collected in any of the box \ncore samples. \n4.3.2 \nEpifauna \nThe sled catches varied between depths but were consistent across the two transects across the \ncontinental slope, inside and outside the canyon system.  \n--- Page 23 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nApproximately 1200 specimens were collected from 25 sled shots. Cnidarians, mostly free-living \ndeep water solitarily corals, were the most abundant phyla, followed by malacostracan crustaceans, \nmostly decapods, bony fish, and sponges. Together, these groups accounted for 70% of the fauna \nby abundance. \nThe fauna was most abundant along the 200 m contour but this was largely a result of the \ndistribution of the free-living deep water, solitarily corals. Seventy percent of the corals collected \noccurred in samples collected from the 200 m sites. Crustaceans were most abundant at 400 m. \nCommercial fishing for crustaceans (scampi, prawns) is concentrated between 200–400 m. Fish \nwere most abundant in shallower water, particularly near the shelf break at 200 m depth. Sponges \nwere most abundant in the deeper stations (600 m and 800 m). Ascidians were common in 150 m \nwhere one unidentified species was particularly abundant. \nThe Western Australian Museum (WAM) has identified the sponges, fish, molluscs, echinoderms, \ncnidarians and most of the crustaceans and made comparisons with existing deepwater collections. \nFive species of sponges, 45 species of fishes, 54 species of molluscs, 25 species of cnidarians, 34 \nspecies of echinoderms, and 50 species of crustaceans have been identified. \nThe WAM findings can be summarised as follows:  \n \nOf the five species of sponges collected in the study, three belonged to the Class \nDemospongiae, which are shallow water sponges found at depths of 150 m or 200 m and two \nspecies belong to the Class Hexactinellida (glass sponges), which are deepwater species found \nat 600 m and 800 m. The glass sponges have a glass stalk holding the cup shaped sponge. The \nstalk is often covered in a cnidarian. No live sponges were collected from tows at 400 m. \n \nThe fish species collected are typical of the area and depths with most of the taxa being \ndeepwater representatives with tropical distribution.  \n \nThe echinoderm species belonged mainly to three classes, namely Asteroidea (seastars), \nOphiuroidea (brittlestars) and Echinoidea (urchins), with only one species representing the \nclass Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers). A number of animals could be identified to species level, \nwith some of the identified species not previously recorded and many were not previously \nrecorded in the area. Curiously, when compared to other recent sampling off the north west \npeninsula, several Asteriod genera found in similar water depths were absent in the Pluto \nsamples. The Asteroid Sidonaster waney have not previously been recorded within Australian \nwaters. Of the eleven Asteroid genera found, only 4 species could be identified to species level. \n \nThe cnidarian species belonged mainly to the Family Nephtheidae and to a lesser extent the \nFamily Alcyoniidae and Nephtheidae. Of the 41 cnidarian specimens, three specimens were \nblack coral. \n \nThe majority of the 50 crustacean species identified belonged to the Order Decapoda (48 \ndecapods and two barnacles, Order Pedunculata). Most of the genera collected have been \nrecorded previously from the deeper waters of Western Australia and all species were collected \nat depths typical for the species or genus. The material is mainly tropical with strong Indo- \nWest Pacific affinities, particularly with the fauna of the Indo-Malayan sub-province, the area \ndefined by the Indo-Malayan Archipelago, Australia and New Guinea to Japan. At the generic \n--- Page 24 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nlevel, the collection is comparable with material from similar depths in eastern Australian \nwaters. The collection contains the first Australian records of Raninoides hendersoni Chopra, \n1933 (Raninidae), Mursia armata de Haan, 1834 (Calappidae), Polycheles coccifer Galil, 2000 \n(Polychelidae), and Eumunida (Eumunida) pacifica Gordon, 1930 (Chyrostylidae). These species \nhave known distributions in the Indo-Malayan sub-province of the Indo-west Pacific province. \nOne species previously recorded in Australia from the east coast is recorded for the first time, \nConchoecetes artificiosus (Dromiidae). A further two species, Agonida ? eminens and A. ? incerta \n(Galatheidae), are possible new records for WA but confirmation of their identifications is \nrequired. The specimens of the portunid crab Charybdis (Charybdis) rufodactylus represent the \nfirst record of the species outside of Queensland, Australia. The galitheid genus Munidopsis is \nalso reported for first time from WA. \n \nMost of the 45 mollusc species had been previously recorded from western and northern \nAustralian waters (WAM, January 2006), although some of the specimens in the collection \nbelong to species that have been rarely collected for example, Amoria diamantina. Most \nmolluscs occurred in depths of between 150 and 600 m. They represent 27 families, of which \nfour are cephalopods, three are bivalves and the remaining 47 species are gastropods. The \ngastropods represented in this collection are mainly carnivores as would be expected from \ndepths low in and below the photic zone. The broken shell of the sundial shell, Discotectonica \nacutissima, appears to be the first record for this species in Western Australian waters (WAM, \nJanuary 2006). Of the cephalopods, those specimens identified as probably belonging to the \ngenus Mastigoteuthis are the most noteworthy, being new to the collections of the Western \nAustralian Museum. The actual depth at which the squids of the genera Histioteuthis and \nMastigoteuthis were collected is doubtful as they swim in the water column, not on the \nsubstrate, and so must have been taken as the dredge was descending or ascending (Slack-\nSmith 2006). \n4.3.3 \nROV (SKM 2006) \nThe ROV recording was collected during December 2005 from five areas between 250 m and 1050 \nm depth (Figure 4-2). The soft sediments supported a very sparse coverage of epifauna overall but \nsmall areas supporting a higher density of epifaunal were also observed. The diversity of epifauna \nwas far more limited overall than the diversity of fauna collected by the sled. Many tracks and \nmarks were observed on the seabed through all depths but the fauna responsible for these tracks \nor living just below the sediment surface could not be identified. Only demersal species could be \nidentified. The seafloor below about 800 m supported a similar fauna to that observed in shallow \ndepths with mostly shrimps, batfish and holothurians observed. Glass sponges were noted to occur \nat high densities, particularly along the 750 m depth contour with an estimated density of 0.2 \nindividuals/m2. \n--- Page 25 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \nThe majority of the substrate consisted of soft sediments, which were green, grey in colour below \nabout 400 m and a light brown in shallower depths. Box core samples found the sediments to be \nsilt below about 400 m and fine sand above this depth. Seabed gradients varied from flat to \ngradients in excess of 80°. Preliminary results from the geotechnical and geophysical survey of the \nPluto field indicate that the seabed of the Pluto field is devoid of hard substrate except for two \nareas of seabed (M. Bowler [Woodside] 2006 pers. comm., January) which are particularly \nnoteworthy. \nSea Cliffs \nPreliminary results of the geotechnical and geophysical studies (completed during the Geoconsult \n2006 survey), which commenced at the same time as the offshore environmental survey, indicate \nthat the continental slope at the Pluto field is largely devoid of hard substrate exposed above the \nsedimentary seafloor. The main area of exposed hard substrate occurs in about 1000 m depth \nwhere the continental slope meets the abyssal plain (Figure 4-3).  \n--- Page 26 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1045m) \nThe bottom of the rocky cliffs is situated in about 1050 m water depths with an almost vertical wall \nextending 20 m up to about 1030 m at the surveyed location. The rock appears to be sedimentary \nwith clear bands or layers occurring in the rock profile.  No epifauna was observed on the exposed \nrock. Where the seabed gradients are less steep, sediments accumulate and large anemones and \nbatfish were observed. However, both the abundance and diversity of epifauna was limited in these \nrock areas, compared to the sedimentary seabed located above and below this area of rock cliffs. \nThe size of the areas were not stated but were limited in size. \nFrom about 1030 m to 880 m, rock and mud stone outcrops occur, interspersed with large areas of \nsoft sediment which in places supported large numbers of glass sponges. Observations of the \nROV’s manipulator arm indicated that the mudstone was very soft, disintegrating very easily. The \nmudstone was quite flat in areas with limited vertical relief and the sediment build up on the \nexposed rock and mudstone minimal, which suggests that sediment movement down the slope is \nvery limited and/or strong currents sweep away exposed sediments. \nRock Pinnacles \nThe only other exposed hard substrate known to occur in the Pluto field is a series of rock \npinnacles located about 300 m water depth (Figure 4-4). Results from the geotechnical studies \nindicate that there are a number of these pinnacles present in a confined area along the 300 m \ndepth contour. They are also described as “coral heads” as they up to 2.5 m in height and 6 m in \ndiameter which often occur in over 10m deep scour depressions (Geoconsult 2005). \nThe pinnacles contain a very low percentage cover of live soft coral with only a few live specimens \nof soft coral observed growing on top of the pinnacles. \n--- Page 27 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n4.3.4 \nROV (Ocean Affinity 2018) \nA total of seven POIs were surveyed using ROV in July 2018 by Ocean Affinity.  POIs 3, 4 and 5 \nwere mostly flat, sandy seabed, whereas PO1 encountered some of the  pinnacles previously \ndescribed. \nThe original SKM (2006) survey incorrectly identified the the rock pinnacle structures as biogenic in \norigin having been  created by the deep-water coral Lophelia (SKM 2005).  The subsequent ROV \nsurvey, completed by Ocean Affinity (July 2018), collected much higher resolution imagery of the \nrock pinnacle field which were sent to Professor Murray Roberts (University of Edinburgh) for \nexpert assessment.  It was confirmed that the yellow corals which were originally identified as \nLophelia were “at first glance Dendrophyllia cornigera (well known in the Mediterranean Sea), but \nperhaps more likely a Leptosammia species (same family: Dendrophylliidae)”.  It was also confirmed \nthat there was no evidence of Lophelia sp. in the imagery that was reviewed (M. Roberts, pers. \ncomm). \n \n--- Page 28 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \nThe pinnacles also provide structure for a diversity of fauna including fish and invertebrates. Many \ntens of fish were observed gathered around these pinnacles, most probably belonging to either the \nGlaucosomidae or Pricanthidae families.  Crinoids, hydroids and ophiuroids were also common.  \nOther species visible on the mounds include anemones, soft corals, small crustacean like shrimp \nand some larger brachyurans, possibly Cyrtomaia suhmii (Figure 4-7). \n \n--- Page 29 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 30 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nExamples of the soft seabed from POI 3, 4 and 5 are shown in Figure 4-9. \n \n--- Page 31 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \nThe POI 2 was mostly soft sandy seabed, with one of the images capturing a solitary dory (Family \nZeidae) close to the seabed (Figure 4-10).  POI 6 was similar, with very little epifauna visible on the \nseabed.  Species such as that shown in Figure 4-11 were uncommon.  \n \n \nAll points of interest including the pinnacle field located at POI1 are shown in Figure 4-12. The ROV \nfootage confirms that that the seabed along the trunkline alignment is entirely soft sediment \nbenthos and that the pinnacles at their closest point are more than 350m away from the proposed \ntrunkline alignment. \n \n--- Page 32 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 33 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.4 \nDiscussion \nThe greatest proportion of images analysed from around the Pluto field survey consist of soft \nsediments supporting a typically sparse deep-water fauna. The fauna was typical of the fauna \nexpected on the North-West Shelf (NWS) and slope. A total of 231 epifaunal species and 32 \ninfaunal species were identified during the SKM (2006) survey. \nThe infauna of the Pluto field was sparse but highly diverse (given the limited number of \nindividuals collected). While a number of epifaunal species had not been recorded previously in \nAustralia, Western Australia or the NWS region, this is attributed to the limited number of previous \nstudies of the continental slope rather than the rarity of the fauna (SKM 2006). \nDespite the limited distance between the Pluto and the Vincent and Enfield fields, the proportion \nof epibenthic species common to both fields was low. The distribution of fauna across the Pluto \nfield differs to the patterns observed by AIMS during their recent studies around the Vincent and \nEnfield fields, where the fauna was patchily distributed and more strongly related to substrate type \n(rock outcrops versus soft sediments) than depth. The diversity of epifauna at Pluto was also lower \nthan was observed in the AIMS studies off the North West Cape but this is largely attributable to \nthe lack of rock outcrops in shallow water in the Pluto field. \nWhile the majority of the Pluto field seabed was comprised of soft sediments, geotechnical data \nindicated the presence of a pinnacle field located in about 300 m depth. The pinnacle field covers \nan area  that is less than 3km2 and consist of solitary outcrops rather than continuous reef. It \nremains unclear what the rock pinnacles are constructed from, however the structures provide \nhabitat for a diverse suite of epifaunal and demersal species, including fish that are not usually \nfound on the soft sediments.  \n4.5 \nSummary \nThe fauna observed was consistent with what would be expected to be found at the surveyed \ndepths on the North West Shelf. The distribution of fauna across the Pluto field differs to the \npatterns observed by AIMS (Heyward and Rees 2001a and 2001b; Heyward et al. 2001 and 2001b) \nduring historical studies around the Vincent and Enfield fields, off North West Cape. AIMS \nobserved that the fauna was patchily distributed and more strongly related to substrate type (rock \noutcrops versus soft sediments) than depth. At Vincent and Enfield, the highest diversity of fauna \nwas found on exposed rock outcrops. Preliminary geotechnical and geophysical data suggests that \nhard substrate is limited in the Pluto field. ROV recordings also indicate that the hard substrate \nlocated around 1000 m does not support a rich epifaunal community. The depth of water and \nsediment movement over the near vertical walls of the hard substrate may be the factors limiting \nthe development of a rich epifaunal community (SKM 2006). \nDespite the lack of similarities between the fauna in the collections made at Vincent-Enfield and \nthe historical survey at the Pluto field, which are separated by less than 300 km, the Western \nAustralian Museum researchers indicated that the species recorded from the Pluto field are \nrepresentative of the area and collection depths with most species having been collected \npreviously. \n \n--- Page 34 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n5 \nContinental Shelf \n5.1 \nBackground \nThe assessment of the offshore habitats that occur on the continental shelf (<300m water depth), \nhave been based on ROV footage collected as part of subsea facility inspections around the Pluto \nfield within Permit Area WA-34-L and WA-48-L.  Whilst the Pluto platform itself is located within \nWA-48-L, in 83m water depth, much of the subsea infrastructure including pipelines and wellheads \nare in WA-34-L in ~190m water depth.  The seabed composition through these areas has been \npreviously described as being predominantly flat and featureless and comprises thick, \nunconsolidated fine grained sands. The sediments support soft sediment benthic communities \ndominated by infauna (including molluscs, crustaceans and worms) and isolated larger fauna (free \nswimming cnidarian, demersal fish and benthic crustaceans). \n5.2 \nSurvey Method \nA total of 56 ROV video records from several subsea inspections were used as a basis for \nassessment. These included a review of footage from the following locations: \n \nXeres-1A Well Head, (depth ~190m) \n \nPluto Frond Mats (2015-2017), (depth ~170m) \n5.3 \nResults \n5.3.1 \nXeres Well Head \nThe footage from the wellhead confirms that the seabed is comprised of soft unconsolidated \nsediments, possibly fine sand silts (Figure 5-1).  The well head structure provides hard substrate for \nthe colonisation by a range of invertebrates such as barnacles, hydroids and anemones.  The \nstructure in turn provides habitat for a range of fish species, as shown in Figure 5-1. \n \n--- Page 35 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n5.3.2 \nPluto Frond Mats \nThe footage from the annual surveys of the Pluto frond mats also confirms that the seabed \nsurrounding the pipeline is comprised of soft unconsolidated sediments that is mainly fine sand \n(Figure 5-4, Figure 5-5, Figure 5-5).   \n \n \n5.1 \nDiscussion \nEpifauna was observed to be most abundant on the continental shelf (150–200 m) and the \nabundance of the fauna appeared to be inversely associated with depth, with distinct differences in \nthe fauna on the Shelf and slope (SKM 2006). However additional analysis of the proposed \ntrunkline route shows the pipelines and wellheads offer significant areas of hard bottom habitat in \na region that is characterised by soft unconsolidated sediments.  Figure 5-3 provides a snapshot of \nimages from the ROV locations surveyed relative to the trunkline alignment.   Due to the uniform \nnature of the seabed across much of this area of shelf (as also confirmed by regional \ngeomorphological mapping, refer to IMCRA 4.0), the ROV locations are considered representative \nof the larger project area and have been used to confirm that the trunkline route over the entire \nsection of seabed is likely to be dominated by sand and other sediment types. \nIt is the pipeline itself that provides hard substrate for the establishment of a habitat that supports \na diversity of species that includes invertebrates and fish.  The images within Figure 5-4 and Figure \n5-5 show how cover by species can also vary. The most common forms present include barnacles, \nsea whips (Octocorals), anemones, hydroids and to a lesser extent sponges and crinoids.  The type \nand number of fish present is also highly variable and also depends on the relative position of the \npipeline above the seabed. Partially buried pipelines do not appear to provide the same habitat \ncomplexity and opportunity that suspended or resting pipelines provide (McLean et al. 2017).   \nFish assemblages and colonising invertebrate habitats on these artificial hard substrates also vary \nwith depth and age.  Generally speaking, the structures that are located in shallower water (<135m) \nhad a greater diversity of fish compared to habitats at 350m depth where the number of fish \nspecies and abundance declined markedly (McLean et al. 2018).  The study by Bond (et al. 2018) \nalso confirmed that compared to adjacent natural seabed habitats, pipeline fish fauna were \ncharacterised by higher relative abundance and biomass of commercially important species. \n--- Page 36 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 37 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 38 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 39 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n6 \nConclusions \nRegional studies and the site specific studies reviewed indicate that seabed material along the \nproposed pipeline alignment (and around the gas field) is predominantly flat and featureless and \ncomprises thick, unconsolidated fine grained sands. The sediments support soft sediment benthic \ncommunities dominated by infauna (including molluscs, crustaceans and worms) and isolated \nlarger fauna (free swimming cnidarian, demersal fish and benthic crustaceans).  \nSedimentary infauna associated with soft unconsolidated sediments of the general area is \nwidespread and well represented along the continental shelf and upper slopes in the NWS region \n(Woodside 2004; SKM, 2007; Brewer et al., 2007; RPS, 2011). Consequently, in the context of the \ncontiguous extent of habitats across the region, benthic habitat along the proposed pipeline \nalignment consists primarily of soft unconsolidated sediments and is considered to be of relatively \nlow environmental sensitivity. \nBenthic communities of filter feeders generally live in areas that have strong currents and hard \nsubstratum (CALM, 2005) and are closely associated with substrate type, with areas of hard \nsubstrate typically supporting more diverse epibenthic communities (Heyward et al., 2001).  The \nonly natural habitat that is not classified as soft sediment is the pinnacle field that lies in about \n300m water depth, on the continental slope. The pinnacle field covers an area less than 3km2 but \nthe pinnacles are isolated forms and do not constitute continuous reef. It remains unclear what the \npinnacles are constructed from, however the structures provide habitat for a diverse suite of \nepifaunal and demersal species that commonly occur elsewhere in the NWS. \nRecent research has also confirmed that habitats containing the greatest biodiversity in these \noffshore environments are the habitats formed by colonising invertebrates on oil and gas subsea \ninfrastructure including the well heads and pipelines.  These habitats and the species present on \nthese structures in the NWS of Western Australia have been subject to detailed assessment by \nMcLean et al. (2018), Bond et al. (2018) and McLean et al. (2017). These habitats not only have \nstructural complexity but also create habitat for a large diversity of fish species that commonly \noccur elsewhere in the NWS but do not occur over soft unconsolidated sediments.   \n \n \n--- Page 40 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Scarborough \nOffshore Benthic Marine Habitat Assessment \n \n \n \n \n7 \nReferences \nApache (2013).

Woodside is proposing to develop the Scarborough gas resource through new \noffshore facilities connected by an approximately 430 km pipeline onshore. The proposal is to initially \ndevelop the Scarborough gas field with wells, tied back to a semi-submersible floating production \nunit (FPU) moored in 900 m of water close to the Scarborough field. This report has been developed \nin support of environmental approvals associated with the Scarborough Project.  \nAs part of the trunkline installation, Woodside is assessing the feasibility of using backfill material \nfrom a potential borrow ground that has been identified in Commonwealth Waters. The potential \nborrow ground is located adjacent to the north-western extent of the habitat protection zone of the \nDampier Marine Park. A benthic habitat survey of the potential borrow ground and surrounding \nareas within the Dampier Marine Park was commissioned (this study) to support the environmental \nimpact assessment of the intended activities. \nSurveys of marine benthic habitat of the potential borrow ground and nearby areas within the \nDampier Marine Park were undertaken between 18th and 20th December 2018. This report presents \nthe methodology and results from the survey. \nBare sandy substrate dominated most of the locations where towed/drop camera transects were \nconducted. Where biota was observed, it typically consisted of invertebrates such as anemones and \ncrinoids at densities no greater than 10% and typically less than 5% cover. Of the 24 survey locations \nwithin the potential borrow ground, sparse invertebrate cover was observed at only two locations. \nOf the 51 survey locations within the habitat protection zone of the Dampier Marine Park, sparse \ninvertebrate cover was observed at 12 locations. \n \n--- Page 49 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \nIntroduction \n1.1 \nProject Background \nWoodside is assessing the feasibility of using backfill material from a potential borrow ground in \nCommonwealth Waters. The potential borrow ground is adjacent to the north western extent of the \nDampier Marine Park (DMP). The area of the DMP that is adjacent to the potential borrow ground is \nan International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Protected Area. It has been attributed \nCategory IV status, which has the primary objective to maintain, conserve and restore species and \nhabitats. An understanding of benthic communities at and surrounding the potential borrow ground \nis required to help inform the impact assessment for the intended activities associated with using \nthe potential borrow ground. \nThis report presents the methodology and reports the findings of the benthic habitat survey that \nwas undertaken in December 2018 at the potential borrow ground and adjacent areas within the \nDMP. \n1.2 \nScope of Work \nThe primary aim of the Commonwealth Waters survey was to gather information to support an \nenvironmental impact assessment of using the proposed borrow ground. The survey was completed \nto acquire qualitative data on species present, and to report on the presence of sensitive benthic \nbiota or habitat near the proposed borrow ground and the adjacent DMP. \n1.3 \nSurvey Location \nThe potential borrow ground is located directly north of the western extent of the DMP, about 9 km \nnorth of the north-western extent of Legendre Island, outside the Dampier Archipelago (Figure 1-1). \n--- Page 50 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n \nPark \n1.4 \nPrevious Knowledge \nThe Marine Park was proclaimed in December 2013, though has been known as Dampier Marine \nPark since October 2017. DMP is significant because, as a whole, it provides protection for offshore \nshelf habitats adjacent to the Dampier Archipelago, the area between Dampier and Port Hedland \nand a seafloor rich with sponges (DNP, 2018). The habitat protection zone adjacent to the potential \nborrow ground is allocated Category IV Protection as it provides important habitat for benthic \ncommunities in the region. Previous knowledge of the benthic habitats and communities of the \nsurvey location includes a study by the CSIRO (Pitcher et al 2016), which covered an extensive area \nof the west Pilbara describing benthic habitats and categorizing the assemblages’ present. The \nsurvey location appears to be on the outer fringes of the CSIRO study. Bathymetric information was \nlimited to nautical charts of the region. \n \n--- Page 51 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n2 \nMethods \n2.1 \nSurvey Design \nTo optimise the field campaign, survey locations for video and still images were positioned to target \nthe potential borrow ground and surrounding area (Figure 2-1). A 5km buffer was applied to the \npotential borrow ground to define the survey area in the Dampier Marine Park.  \nExisting historical data was not available to assist with directing survey effort. To maximise spatial \ncoverage over this area in the available timeframe, a 1 km grid survey pattern was applied. Locations \nwithin the potential borrow ground and locations in the DMP closest to the potential borrow ground, \nwere prioritised. \n \nDampier Marine Park \n2.2 \nField Survey  \nThe field survey was undertaken onboard the vessel Kaelani, operated by Bhagwan Marine, between \n16th and 20th December 2018. A total of 24 transects were completed within the potential borrow \nground and a further 51 transects were completed within the DMP during the survey. Transects \nvaried in length from 30 m to about 230 m, though were typically around 100 m (Figure 2-2). The \nplanned survey locations at the southern extent of the DMP were unable to be surveyed due to time \nconstraints. Habitat data was obtained using a towed/drop camera array including digital recordings \nof high resolution still photographs and high definition video footage. When possible, real-time \n--- Page 52 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \nstandard definition footage was observed by an attending marine scientist on the vessel. Preliminary \nqualitative habitat information was recorded into log sheets for subsequent review. Information \nrecorded to the log sheet for each transect included: \n \ntransect number (identifier) \n \ntime of transect data collection (start/end) and observed changes of habitat \n \ndominant benthic habitat (substrate type and biota density) \n \napproximate depth (as measured by the vessel echo sounder) \n \ngeneral comments relating to each transect. \nSpatial positioning data was acquired using a Garmin GPSMap 62 and a Holux RCV-3000 located \nonboard the vessel. Two units were used for redundancy. The global positioning system (GPS) units \nrecorded a tracklog for each day of operation and were time-synchronised with the laptops and \ncameras used to record habitat data. \nAt each survey location the camera array started recording on the deck of the vessel, where \ninformation about the transect and location was recorded before the array was deployed. Once the \ncamera array reached the seabed, the vessel was allowed to drift for two to three minutes, depending \non the rate of drift. When real-time viewing was available and more complex habitat was observed, \nor bathymetry was more variable, the transect/drift was allowed to proceed for a longer period but \ncapped at around five minutes for operational efficacy. The typical drift speed was between 0.5 and \n1.7 knots according to the vessel chart plotter.  \n \nground and Dampier Marine Park, December 2018  \n--- Page 53 ---\nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n2.3 \nBenthic Habitat Characterisation \nHigh level habitat classes were derived from a benthic habitat map of the Dampier Archipelago by \nMScience (2018). These classes were refined based on habitats and biota observed during the survey \n(Table 2-1). The video footage and still imagery was reviewed after the field survey was complete, to \nconfirm habitat classifications and to refine spatial data where necessary by improving time logs of \nhabitat boundaries and transect start/end points. Where habitat boundaries or changes in epibenthic \ndensity were different to the initial logs, the elapsed time in the video was applied to determine the \ntime and relative spatial position for the particular attribute and a new revision of the log was created. \nHabitat information was georeferenced by relating the times recorded on the log sheets with the \nposition logged by the GPS onboard the vessel. Position information was logged by the Holux GPS \neach second. For each spatial position received, the relative habitat information was attributed to \ncreate habitat point data of the areas surveyed. \nHabitat point data was imported into ArcMap geographical information systems platform to create \nEsri shape files and to be displayed with other relevant spatial data for presentation in this report. \nHabitat Class \nDefinition  \nCoral \nHard coral communities dominate and were present in ≥10% cover. Some \nminor biota may be present (i.e. ascidians, bryozoans and sponges); \nhowever, they are secondary in density and ecological function. No coral \nwas observed along any of the survey transects. \nAlgae \nMacroalgae were the dominant biota (≥10% cover) over a consolidated \nhard substrate that may contain sparse (≤10%) secondary biota (i.e. solitary \ncorals or seagrasses). No macroalgae or seagrass was observed along any \nof the survey transects. \nInvertebrates \nSessile and mobile benthic invertebrate biota (including crinoids, ascidians, \nhydroids and sponges) were present (≥3%) on sandy substrate with little or \nno other biota. Both sessile and mobile invertebrates were observed along \nsurvey transects. Example images are supplied in Figure 2-3. \nBare Sediment \nSubstrate is predominantly bare sand. Biota is very sparse (≤10% cover of \nmacroalgae or coral and ≤3% invertebrates) or entirely absent. Bare \nsediment was the dominant habitat class in the survey transects. Example \nimages are supplied in Figure 2-4. \n--- Page 54 ---\n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 55 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 56 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n3 \nResults \n3.1 \nBenthic Habitat \nAt the proposed borrow ground bare sandy substrate dominated areas where towed/drop camera \ntransects were conducted. Where biota was observed, it typically consisted of invertebrates such as \nanemones and crinoids at densities no greater than 10%. Of the 24 survey locations, invertebrates \nwere observed at only two (Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3). Most transects were conducted in depths \nbetween 40 m and 42 m. Four transects were conducted in water depths between 37 and 40 m.  \nLike the potential borrow ground, bare sandy substrate dominated areas where towed/drop camera \ntransects were conducted in the Dampier Marine Park. Where biota was observed, it typically \nconsisted of invertebrates such as anemones and crinoids at densities no greater than 10%. Of the \n51 survey locations, sparse invertebrate cover (3–10%) was observed at 12 of them (Figure 3-4, \nranging from 31 m to 43 m. No particular association between habitat and depth is evident based \non this data.  \n \nlocated \n \n--- Page 57 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 58 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 59 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 60 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 61 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 62 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n \n4 \nDiscussions and Conclusions \nTowed video and drop camera survey of both the potential borrow ground and the DMP directly \nadjacent to the borrow ground confirm that the seabed and its benthic composition are relatively \nuniform in structure and composition. Both locations are dominated by bare substrate with large \nareas of seabed that are apparently largely devoid of any epibenthic species. Where epibenthos is \npresent, the percentage cover of species is comparatively low (in the order of 5%), with no transects \nrecording greater than 10% coverage in the species present.  \nCommon species present were alcyonaceans (mainly solitary soft corals), pennatulaceans (sea pens), \ncrinoids (feather stars), asteroids (sea stars), anemones and hydroids. No benthic primary producer \nhabitat in the form of hard corals, macroalgae or seagrass was recorded or observed along any of \nthe survey transects. \nThe benthic habitat observed during this survey appears to be consistent with a broad scale \ncharacterisation of the Pilbara seabed undertaken by UWA and CSIRO (Pitcher et al 2016), which \ncategorises this area as “Assemblage 2” and describes it as “typically bare seabed interspersed with \nmoderately high cover of whips (0– 95.6%), median gorgonians (0–12.4%) and median sponges (0–\n73.4%), some cover of algae (0 25%), and low cover of alcyonarians (0–2.2%), corals (0–6.8%), coral \nreef (0–5.4%), bioturbation (0– 13.4%) and halimeda (0–0.8%), and ~no cover of seagrass”.  \nThe similarity between benthic habitats observed within the potential borrow ground and habitat \nprotection zone of the DMP during this survey, and those described above as Assemblage 2, \nindicates that the area surveyed is well represented in the regional context as opposed to more \nspatially discrete habitat features such as submerged coral reefs (Delambre Reef) and shoals (Tessa \nShoals). \n \n \n--- Page 63 ---\n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nDampier Archipelago \nCommonwealth Waters Marine Benthic \nHabitat Survey \n \n \n5 \nReferences \nDNP (Director of National Parks), 2018.

the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n \nExecutive Summary    \nThe Scarborough gas resource is located approximately 375 km west-north-west off the Burrup \nPeninsula and is part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields. Woodside is proposing to develop the \nScarborough gas resource through new offshore facilities connected by an approximately 430 km \npipeline onshore. The proposal is to initially develop the Scarborough gas field with wells, tied back \nto a semi-submersible floating production unit (FPU) moored in 900 m of water close to the \nScarborough field. This report has been developed in support of environmental approvals \nassociated with the Scarborough Project.  \nThis report provides the results of ROV surveys which were undertaken for the Scarborough project \nto characterise benthic habitat along the proposed trunkline route within the Montebello \nAustralian Marine Park (AMP). \nThe objectives of this study were to: \n \nConfirm the environmental characteristics (physical and biological attributes) of the seabed \nalong the pipeline route, including identification and qualitative descriptions of seabed \nhabitat types and their general distribution; \n \nProvide spatial and habitat representation of the area of the Montebello AMP that the \ntrunkline traverses; and \n \nProvide benthic habitat data at Key Ecological Features (KEFs) including the ancient \ncoastline at the 125m depth contour KEF and potential turtle foraging habitat on hard \nsubstrate in the AMP where the trunkline overlaps. \nFive areas within the Montebello AMP were surveyed, with three Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) \nvideo transects undertaken within each area, except for Area 5 where only one transect was \ncompleted. The benthic habitat and epibenthic organisms within each area of the Montebello AMP \nwere characterised through the assessment of the high definition (HD) video collected. Benthic \nhabitat was described and classified in accordance with the CATAMI Classification Scheme for \nScoring Marine Biota and Substrata in Underwater Imagery. Area 1, which was by far the deepest \nlocation, and which had one transect within the KEF, was most different with a much lower cover of \nbenthic organisms than Areas 2 to 5. Areas 2 to 5 were quite similar in depth and in nature, with \nsome small differences in the density and occurrence of benthic organisms and also in substrate \ntype (e.g. variants of soft sediment bedforms and cover of biologenic gavel). A summary of \nfindings for each area is provided below along with a discussion of the ROV results in relation to \nthe published values for the Montebello AMP and 125m Depth Contour KEF.  \nArea 1 Summary \nArea 1 was selected to assess the benthic habitat in the vicinity of the ancient coastline 125 m \ndepth contour KEF and to provide spatial coverage of the AMP. One transect in Area 1 was located \nwithin the KEF (Transect 1A) and was 0.8 km from the eastern edge and 1.36 km from the north-\nwestern edge of the KEF. The most northern tip of this transect was located 0.45 km from the \n--- Page 73 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n \nnorthern edge of the Montebello AMP and the south-western tip was 1.238 km from the western \nedge of the Montebello AMP. The depth at the midpoint of the transects surveyed in this area \nranged from 103.2 m to 126.4 m. Benthic habitat was typically bare sand with various bedforms. \nSome areas of seafloor were covered in a light bacterial mat and others were seen to have a cover \nof biologenic gravel. No moderate or high relief features or areas of consolidated hard substrate \nwere present. Benthic organisms (sponges and soft corals) typically occurred as single or in very \nlow density aggregations. Mobile organisms including fish and echinoderms were also present on \noccasion.  \nThe environmental values of the KEF refer to potential areas of hard substrate or rocky \nescarpments which may provide enhanced biodiversity or biologically important habitat in areas \notherwise dominated by soft sediments. However, no potential features of the KEF described above \nwere observed in any of the transects surveyed in Area 1.  \nArea 2 to 5 \nAreas 2 to 5 were selected to provide spatial coverage of the AMP, investigate areas of potentially \nhigh rugosity, areas that may include ancient coastline and areas of potential turtle foraging \nhabitat. The depths in areas 2 to 5 were very similar with the midpoints depth of transects ranging \nfrom approximately 70 m to 78 m. The benthic habitats present along all transects in Areas 2 to 5 \nwere very similar to each other. The seafloor in each area was relatively flat and sandy with a light \nto high cover of unconsolidated biologenic gravel and/or organic material. Small undulations of \nthe seafloor were seen at times, as was scouring which typically occurred around large benthic \norganisms or aggregations of organisms. No significant high relief habitat features, or obvious \nareas of consolidated hard substrate, were observed in Areas 2 to 5. Benthic epifauna was present \nover the length of each transect, occurring in patches which varied from low (~5%) to high (~80%) \ndensity. Area 5 tended to have lower cover of organisms than areas 2 to 4. Benthic fauna in all of \nthese areas comprised a diverse array of sponges and soft corals with varying forms, sizes and \ncolours. Hydroids were also apparent. Mobile fauna including echinoderms (sea stars, feather stars) \nand Holothurians (sea cucumbers) and fish were common along most of the transects. Fish were \nespecially abundant amongst the patches of sponges and corals. Bioturbation of the seafloor was \ncommon over the entire transect length and usually occurred in the form of thin trails, small \nmounds or craters. \nFor many transects a higher cover of benthic organisms was often seen in areas with higher \namounts of biologenic gravel, however, benthic organisms were in no way limited to these areas, \nalso being common in areas with fine sediment with little or no biologenic gravel. While at times \nthe occurrence of benthic organisms could be loosely related to areas of high rugosity seen on \ndetailed bathymetric mapping, this was not always apparent.  \nThe high biodiversity of sessile and mobile organisms seen at depths of around 70 m – 78 m in \nAreas 2 to 5 of the Montebello AMO was in accordance with the natural values of the Montebello \nAMP in that the area surveyed ‘includes diverse benthic and pelagic fish communities’. These areas \nare all likely to provide foraging habitat for mobile (and potentially threatened) fauna such as \nmarine turtles and other fish fauna that feed on soft bodied benthic organisms such as sponges \nand soft corals. \n--- Page 74 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n \nThe benthic habitat descriptions in the current study are generally in alignment with the findings of \nprevious (recent and historical) benthic habitat surveys undertaken in the Montebello AMP. These \nstudies have also reported the typical benthic habitat in the AMP as low relief sandy seafloor (with \nvarious bedforms such as ripples and ridges) with occasional areas of rubble (often increasing at \nmore inshore sites). Dominant benthic organisms recorded for the AMP (noted to vary in diversity \nand density between sites) typically include a wide variety of sponges, soft corals and crinoids.  \n \n \n--- Page 75 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n             \n \n \n1 \nIntroduction \n1.1 \nProject Background \nThe Scarborough gas resource is located approximately 375 km west-north-west off the Burrup \nPeninsula and is part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields which are estimated to hold 9.2 Tcf (2C, \n100%) of dry gas. Woodside is proposing to develop the Scarborough gas resource through new \noffshore facilities connected by an approximately 430 km pipeline onshore. The proposal is to \ninitially develop the Scarborough gas field with wells, tied back to a semi-submersible floating \nproduction unit (FPU) moored in 900 m of water close to the Scarborough field. This report has \nbeen developed in support of environmental approvals associated with the Scarborough Project.  \nActivities undertaken as a part of the Scarborough Project will include seabed preparation and \ntrunkline installation activities, which will result in localised seabed disturbance and ongoing \nphysical presence of the trunkline for the life of the project. The proposed pipeline is \napproximately 32 inch in diameter and the disturbance corridor is estimated at less than 30 m. The \nScarborough trunkline is proposed to traverse through the northern section of the Montebello \nAustralian Marine Park (AMP) as shown in Figure 1-1. This report provides the results of ROV \nsurveys which were undertaken for the Scarborough Project to characterise benthic habitat along \nthe proposed trunkline route within the Montebello AMP.  \n \n--- Page 76 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n1.2 \nEnvironmental Setting of the Proposed Trunkline Route \nThe Scarborough Project occurs in Commonwealth waters off the northwest coast of Western \nAustralia (WA) within the North-west Marine Region (NWMR) (Integrated Marine and Coastal \nRegionalisation of Australia (IMCRA) 4.0). The target fields occur within the Northern Carnarvon \nBasin on the Exmouth Plateau, and are about 380 km offshore from Dampier, in water depths of \napproximately 900 - 970 m, with the proposed trunkline ultimately crossing into State waters along \nthe same alignment as the Pluto Gas Export Pipeline (Figure 1-2). \n \nA number of studies and reviews of the Exmouth Plateau and North West Shelf have been \ncompiled and/or undertaken to provide an understanding of the physical, biological and socio-\neconomic environmental conditions within the Project Area. The majority of these have been made \navailable in the public domain. The environmental values of the Montebello AMP and the ancient \ncoastline KEF have been described in Sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 of this report.  \nThe Trunkline Project Area extends from the State-Commonwealth boundary on the inner \ncontinental shelf, onto the continental slope where it traverses the continental slope westwards to \nthe Offshore Project Area on the Exmouth Plateau. The eastern half of the Trunkline Project Area is \nadjacent to the existing Pluto trunkline. The inner continental shelf is the area from the coast to \n--- Page 77 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \nabout 30 m water depth, and the middle continental shelf is the area between 30 m and 120 m \nwater depth. At about 120 m depth, a terrace (start of the outer shelf) of gradients of between 5° \nand 20° represents a paleo-shoreline and marks an important divide between the continental shelf \nand continental slope (SKM, 2006). Sediments along the Trunkline Project Area are expected to be \ndominated by sand as is typical of the continental slope in the Northwest Transition bioregion \n(DEWHA, 2008a).  \n1.2.1 \nNatural Values of the Montebello AMP \nLocation \nThe Montebello Marine Park is located offshore of Barrow Island and 80 km west of Dampier \nextending from the Western Australian state water boundary and is adjacent to the Western \nAustralian Barrow Island and Montebello Islands Marine Parks. The Marine Park covers an area of \n3413 km² and water depths from less than 15 m to 150 m. The Marine Park was proclaimed under \nthe EPBC Act on 14 December 2013 and renamed Montebello Marine Park on 9 October 2017 \n(Director of National Parks, 2018). \nStatement of Significance \nThe Montebello AMP is significant because it contains habitats, species and ecological \ncommunities associated with the Northwest Shelf Province. It includes one KEF: the ancient \ncoastline at the 125-m depth contour (valued as a unique seafloor feature with ecological \nproperties of regional significance) (environmental values of the KEF are provided in Section 1.2.2).  \nThe Marine Park provides connectivity between deeper waters of the shelf and slope, and the \nadjacent Barrow Island and Montebello Islands Marine Parks. A prominent seafloor feature in the \nMarine Park is Trial Rocks consisting of two close coral reefs. The reefs are emergent at low tide \n(Director of National Parks, 2018). \nNatural Values \nThe values of the Montebello AMP are outlined in the North-west Marine Parks Network \nManagement Plan 2018 (Director of National Parks, 2018). The Marine Park includes examples of \necosystems representative of the Northwest Shelf Province, which is a dynamic environment \ninfluenced by strong tides, cyclonic storms, long-period swells and internal tides. The bioregion \nincludes diverse benthic and pelagic fish communities, and ancient coastline thought to be an \nimportant seafloor feature and migratory pathway for humpback whales. A KEF of the Marine Park \nis the ancient coastline at the 125-m depth contour where rocky escarpments are thought to \nprovide biologically important habitat in areas otherwise dominated by soft sediments (Director of \nNational Parks, 2018). \nThe Marine Park supports a range of species including species listed as threatened, migratory, \nmarine or cetacean under the EPBC Act 1999. Biologically important areas within the Marine Park \ninclude breeding habitat for seabirds, internesting, foraging, mating, and nesting habitat for marine \nturtles, a migratory pathway for humpback whales and foraging habitat for whale sharks (Director \nof National Parks, 2018). \n--- Page 78 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n1.2.2 \nEnvironmental Values of the Ancient Coastline at 125 m Depth \nContour (KEF) \nThe shelf of the North-west Marine Region contains several terraces and steps which reflect \nchanges in sea level that occurred over the last 100 000 years. The most prominent of these \nfeatures occurs as an escarpment along the North West Shelf and Sahul Shelf at a depth of 125 m. \nThe ancient coastline at 125 m depth contour is defined as a KEF as it is a unique seafloor feature \nwith ecological properties of regional significance. The spatial boundary of this KEF, as defined in \nthe Conservation Values Atlas, is defined by depth range 115-135 m in the Northwest Shelf \nProvince and Northwest Shelf Transition provincial bioregions as defined in the Integrated Marine \nand Coastal Regionalisation of Australia (IMCRA v 4.0) (DSEWPaC, 2012). The boundary of the KEF \nin the study area is shown in Figure 2-1. \nEnvironmental Values \nThe ‘environmental values’ of the ‘ancient coastline at 125 m depth contour’ KEF are described in \nthe Marine Bioregional Plan for the North-west Marine Region (DSEWPaC, 2012). The ancient \nsubmerged coastline provides areas of hard substrate and therefore may provide sites for higher \ndiversity and enhanced species richness relative to surrounding areas of predominantly soft \nsediment. Little is known about the fauna associated with the hard substrate of the escarpment, \nlikely to include sponges, corals, crinoids, molluscs, echinoderms and other benthic invertebrates \nrepresentative of hard substrate fauna in the North West Shelf bioregion (DSEWPaC, 2012).  \nThe escarpment may also facilitate increased availability of nutrients off the Pilbara by interacting \nwith internal waves and enhancing vertical mixing of water layers. Enhanced productivity \nassociated with the sessile communities and increased nutrient availability may attract larger \nmarine life such as whale sharks and large pelagic fish (DEWHA, 2008).  \n1.3 \nObjectives \nThe objectives of the current study were to: \n \nCharacterise benthic habitat along the proposed trunkline route in the Montebello AMP;  \n \nConfirm the environmental characteristics (physical and biological attributes) of the seabed \nalong the pipeline route, including identification and qualitative descriptions of seabed \nhabitat types and their general distribution; \n \nProvide spatial and habitat representation of the area of the Montebello AMP that the \ntrunkline traverses; and \n \nProvide benthic habitat data at environmental sensitive locations including the ancient \ncoastline at the 125m depth contour Key Ecological Feature (KEF) and potential turtle \nforaging habitat on hard substrate in the AMP where the trunkline overlaps. \n--- Page 79 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n             \n \n \n2 \nMethods \nHabitat characterisation was undertaken using a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) to \ncapture seabed imagery (video/stills) along pre-defined survey locations. Imagery was then used to \ndescribe the physical habitats and the presence/absence of benthic communities within the vicinity \nof the trunkline route in the section that traverses the Montebello AMP.  \nThe survey was focused along the proposed trunkline route where it deviates from the existing \nPluto pipeline route (located in the eastern area of the multi-use zone of the park). Survey sites \nreflected the potential variation in habitat, as determined by the geophysical data (e.g. bathymetry \nand interpreted seabed substrates) and general representativeness of the main seabed \ncharacteristics of the multi-use zone of the park, that the proposed trunkline route will traverse. \n2.1 \nSurvey Areas \nSeafloor imagery was collected by Neptune, within five survey areas, which were sized \napproximately 4 km x 250 m, inside the Montebello AMP. The survey areas selected provide spatial \ncoverage and representative habitat of the Montebello AMP. The locations of survey areas and \ntransects, along with transect depths are provided in Table 2-1 and Figure 2-1. Figure 2-1 also \nprovides the location of the ancient coastline 125 m depth contour KEF. \nThe five survey areas were selected for the following reasons: \n \nSurvey areas 1: Was selected to assess benthic habitat in the vicinity of the ancient \ncoastline 125 m depth contour KEF and to provide spatial coverage of the AMP (Figure 2-1 \nand Figure 2-2).  \n \nSurvey areas 2 to 5: Were selected to provide spatial coverage of the AMP, identify any \noutcropping / subcropping in rugose areas of seafloor (as seen on bathymetry) and assess \nthe benthic habitat in areas which could provide potential turtle foraging habitat (Figure \n2-1, Figure 2-3, Figure 2-4, Figure 2-5 and Figure 2-6).  \nThe approximate distance between all adjacent transects from each other is shown in Table 2-2. \nWithin each survey area, there were three proposed sampling locations (Figure 2-1). At each \nlocation an ~500 m transect of trunkline was attempted to be surveyed. Transects were to provide \na snake like path deviating from the proposed pipeline route by approximately 100 m each side of \nthe pipeline and were to follow the pipeline route in a parallel direction (rather than running \nperpendicular). A kilometre buffer was allowed around each survey location, for flexibility given \nweather conditions etc. A minimum distance of 200 m between transects was to be maintained. \nDue to strong currents and the ROV tether management it was not possible to run the transect \nacross the proposed pipeline route in Area 5 and the transect locations 5B and 5C were unable to \nbe surveyed. Table 2-1 provides details for all transects.  \n \n--- Page 80 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \nSurvey \nArea \n \nSampling \nLocation \n \nPosition GDA94  \nZone 50 (Midpoint) \nPotential \nSeafloor \nFeatures \nActual \nMidpoint  \nDepth (m) \nLatitude \nLongitude \nSurvey Area \n1 \n1A \n318462.69 \n7787004.58 \n125m contour KEF \n-126.4 \n1B \n319281.801 \n7785309.82 \n125m contour KEF \n-110.2 \n1C \n320006.8476 \n7783542.972 \n125m contour KEF \n-103.2 \nSurvey Area \n2 \n2A \n328859.16 \n7781967.15 \nOutcrop/subcrop \n-70.6 \n2B \n330692.8515 \n7781974.137 \nOutcrop/sand \n-74.4 \n2C \n332650.32 \n7781636.45 \nOutcrop/sand \n-74 \nSurvey Area \n3 \n3A \n336633.23 \n7781316.65 \nOutcrop/subcrop \n-73.8 \n3B \n338590.04 \n7781516.29 \nSand \n-72.5 \n3C \n341540.88 \n7781917.17 \nOutcrop/subcrop \n-71.6 \nSurvey Area \n4 \n4A \n342526.27 \n7782010.53 \nSand \n-75.3 \n4B \n344543.13 \n7782286.02 \nSand/subcrop \n-74.5 \n4C \n346553.46 \n7782136.72 \nSubcrop/outcrop \n-78.2 \nSurvey Area \n5 \n5A \n361146.91 \n7778773.61 \nSand \n-74.6 \n5B \nNot surveyed \nSand \nNA \n5C \nNot surveyed \nSand \nNA \nTransects \nDistance  \n1A TO 1B  \n1.85 km \n1B TO 1C \n1.88 km \n1C TO 2A \n1.88 km \n2A TO 2B  \n1.88 km \n2B TO 2C  \n1.88 km \n2C TO 3A  \n3.98 km \n3A TO 3B \n1.88 km \n3B TO 3C \n2.89 km \n3C TO 4A  \n0.98 km \n4A TO 4B  \n2.06 km \n4B TO 4C \n1.96 km \n4C TO 5A \n15 km \n--- Page 81 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n             \n \n \n \n--- Page 82 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n             \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 83 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 84 ---\nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n2.2 \nRemotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Surveys \nROV surveys were undertaken by Neptune at each of the survey locations provided in Table 2-1 \nand shown in Figure 2-1. HD video was collected from a standardised height of approximately 1 m \nto 2 m. The camera was angled where possible to capture both the seabed and forward facing \nperspective of the general seascape. Depth and geospatial data of the ROV location was recorded \nat all sites. The depth and location of the midpoint of each transect is provided in Table 2-1. \n2.3 \nVideo Analysis \n2.3.1 \nTechnical Memos (Neptune) \nFollowing the collection of the ROV video data, Neptune prepared a short technical memo for each \ntransect which included the survey date, time, area of operations, location, brief seabed \ndescription, conclusions and recommendations and any issues encountered. All technical memos \nwere reviewed and are provided in Appendix A.  \n2.3.2 \nBenthic Habitat Analysis \nPrior to assessment of the benthic habitat, potential differences in seafloor bathymetry / rugosity \nwere identified along each of the transect routes and five points of interest were selected for each. \nOn video analysis, still images from each of these locations were captured.  \n--- Page 85 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \nHigh definition (HD) video data was viewed using VLC Media Player and the benthic habitat and \nsessile organisms present were classified in accordance with the CATAMI Classification Scheme for \nScoring Marine Biota and Substrata in Underwater Imagery (http://CATAMI.github.io/) (Althaus et \nal. 2014). Data specifically collected and reported for each transect included: \n \nSubstrate Type \n \nBedform \n \nRelief \n \nBioturbation \n \nBacterial mats \n \nFlora  \n \nFauna \nHD video assessment showed that the seafloor along all transects was low profile and no moderate \nor high profile features were present within any transect. For all transects surveyed, the seafloor \nhabitat was found to be very similar along the entire transect length, or consisted of a mosaic of \nbenthic habitat types / variations in habitat type which changed continually at small scales \n(typically a couple of m’s) but represented the transect as a whole (e.g. area of bare sandy \nsubstrate, to area of sponges/corals on sandy substrate, back to bare substrate, or continually \nchanging percentage cover of sponges and corals). For these reasons, and the qualitative nature of \nthe assessment, an overall habitat classification was applied to each transect.  \nStill images of the various states of benthic habitat and the sessile benthic organisms seen along \neach transect were also taken from the HD video. Some of these were georeferenced and are \noverlaid on the transect maps. The report Appendices also include a greater number of images \nfrom each transect which are provided to demonstrate the small scale variability within a single \ngeneral habitat type.    \n2.4 \nTransect and Habitat Mapping \nTransects were created as line shapefiles from ROV derived X, Y point data. High resolution (2 m) \nbathymetry data was then used to generate the underlying raster surface as well as 2 m contour \nline data. All data was projected in GDA MGA Zone 50 coordinate system and processed in \nArcMAP 10.4. \nAs the benthic habitat along each individual transect was generally the same and consisted of \noften very small scale (every few meters) and continual changes in substrate (e.g. sand ripple type) \nor the cover of benthic organisms (i.e. changes in density of benthic organisms), georeferenced \n‘habitat types’ were not defined along the length of each transect. Each transect was mapped with \ndetailed seafloor bathymetry and these transect maps were overlaid with georeferenced images of \nthe benthic habitat along the transect.   \n--- Page 86 ---\nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n3 \nResults \n3.1 \nArea 1  \nThree transects (of varying length) were surveyed in Area 1 and are described in more detail below. \nThe depth at the midpoint of these transects ranged from 103.2 m to 126.4 m. One transect in Area \n1 (Transect 1a) was located within the KEF; located 0.8 km from the eastern edge and 1.36 km from \nthe north-western edge of the KEF. The most northern tip of this transect was located 0.45 km from \nthe northern edge of the Montebello AMP and the south-western tip was 1.238 km from the \nwestern edge of the Montebello AMP. While some representative images of each transect are \nprovided in the Sections below, Appendix B provides additional images of the benthic habitat and \norganisms seen along each transect in Area 1.  \n3.1.1 \nArea 1a \nNotes provided by Neptune for Area 1a included: \n\nThe ROV transect crossed the pipeline route at E318445, N7786967 (time stamp 13:49:11).\n\nThe ROV was on bottom at 13:49 and off bottom at 14:03.\n\nThe seabed comprised a flat fine sandy seabed, with small isolated sand waves. There was\na sparse benthic sand-dwelling habitat. Ripples had an organic/algae covering, particularly\nin the troughs. Isolated corals also occurred on the sand.\n\nNo significant high relief habitat features were observed.\n\nDue to strong currents and the ROV tether management it was not possible to run the\ntransect more along the proposed pipeline route.\nAnalysis of video data by Advisian was undertaken and the following additional notes regarding \nbenthic habitat in Area 1a are provided:  \n\nThe entire seafloor along the transect in Area 1a consisted of a low relief, flat and fine\nsandy seabed with bedforms alternating between small 2D and 3D ripples (< 10 cm) and\nsome areas which had no ripples.\n\nNo significant, or other, moderate or high relief features, or areas of hard substrate, were\npresent. The transect ran almost entirely along the 126 m depth contour (Figure 3-2).\n\nTransect 1a was entirely located within the boundary of the ancient coastline KEF (refer to\nsubstrate with high biodiversity) were noted here, and the transect was comprised fully of\nsoft sediment habitat.\n--- Page 87 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n \nThe seabed was generally bare sand (with very occasional benthic epifauna) and much of \nthe transect area was noted to have a light covering of organic matter. This is very likely to \nbe a bacterial mat considering the water depth and lack of light penetration in this location \n(refer to Figure 3-2 and Appendix B for images). \n \nNo benthic flora (i.e. macroalgae or seagrass) was present in Area 1a. \n \nBenthic epifauna were present, although were quite uncommon. They generally occurred \nas single individuals (i.e. not in aggregations / clusters). Benthic epifauna included \nechinoderms (e.g. brittle stars and feather stars), sponges (erect simple, erect laminar, erect \nbranching and cup like forms) and cnidarians (whip corals and quill corals (seapens) (refer \nto Table 3-1 for additional detail and CATAMI classification codes).  \n \nThe percentage cover of benthic organisms (within the entire video frame) in Area 1a \nranged from 0% to ~5% (excluding any cover of biologenic gravel) over the entire transect \nlength. No obvious bathymetric features could be seen on the transect maps or \ncorresponded with the occurrence of different substrate types (e.g. sand ripples / flat sand \n/ steps) or scattered benthic organisms. The benthic organisms recorded occurred on all \ndifferent substrate types/bedforms. \n \nOccasional bioturbation of the seabed in the form of light trails, small mounds and craters \nwas seen over the entire transect indicating the presence of various mobile fauna living on \ntop of and within the seabed.   \n \nMobile fauna were seen on occasion but were also uncommon. They included small bony \nfishes (often quickly moving out of the field of view of the ROV) and jellies. Both types of \nfauna were unidentified. \n \nDue to currents affecting the stability of the ROV, along with a high level of suspended \nmaterial in the water at times, visibility of the seabed was compromised in places. \nHowever, these less visible areas are very likely to be similar to the seafloor which could be \nseen based on the overall transect assessment.   \nA summary of the general benthic habitat characteristics, flora and fauna seen along the transect in \nArea 1a is provided in Table 3-1.

Sand ripples had an organic/algae \ncovering particularly in the troughs. The small sand wave crests (probably less than 0.5 m \nhigh) were cleaner and could be seen to prograde over the sediments burying isolated \nbenthic fauna which typically occurred as soft corals and sponges.  \n \nNo significant high relief habitat features were observed.  \n \nDue to strong currents and the ROV tether management it was not possible to run the \ntransect more along the proposed pipeline route. \nAnalysis of video data by Advisian was undertaken and the following additional notes regarding \nbenthic habitat in Area 1b are provided:  \n \nThe seafloor along the transect in Area 1b was similar to that observed in Area 1a and was \nalso similar along the entire transect length.  \n \nWhere the transect crossed the proposed pipeline route (as per the time stamp provided \nby Neptune), a flat sandy seafloor with 3D ripples was present (see image in Figure 3-3). \n \nBenthic habitat typically consisted of a low relief sandy seabed, with bedforms alternating \nbetween small 2D and 3D ripples and areas of flat sand. A series of small ‘steps’ / rises in \nthe sand occurred over the entire length of the transect and these were generally <50 cm \nhigh. These ‘steps’ were identified as ‘sand wave crests’ by Neptune. Towards the end of \nthe transect the small 2D and 3D sand ripples became slightly less common and the \nseafloor had a slightly flatter form. This area of flatter sand is not considered to be a \nseparate habitat type, nor can it been identified on the transect map showing detailed \nbathymetry. Images of the variable types of sandy seafloor along Transect 1b are provided \nin Figure 3-4 and Appendix B. \n \nNo significant, or other, moderate or high relief features, or areas of consolidated hard \nsubstrate, were present in Area 1b. However, some small areas of scattered biologenic \nrubble (perhaps shell, coral or small gravel) were noted along the transects length (see \ndetailed bathymetry.  \n \nArea 1b was located near to, but not within, the area mapped as the KEF (ancient coastline \n125 m depth contour).

This \ncovering occurred over the entire transect however was more prevalent in the troughs of \nripples and the base of each of the sand ‘steps’. It was also common towards the end of \nthe transect where sand ripples were less common.  \n \nNo benthic flora (i.e. macroalgae or seagrass) was present in Area 1b.  \n \nBenthic epifauna were present, although were relatively uncommon and most often \noccurred as single organisms. Fauna included echinoderms (e.g. feather stars and sea \ncucumbers), cnidaria (e.g. seapens), soft corals and sponges (various erect forms). Some \norganisms were partially buried under the sand and could not be identified (refer to Table \n3-2 for additional detail and CATAMI classification codes).  \n \nThe percentage cover of benthic organisms (within the entire video frame) in Area 1b \nranged from 0% to ~10% (excluding cover of biologenic gravel) over the entire transect \nlength. As for Transect 1a, no obvious bathymetric features were seen on the transect \nmaps or corresponded with the occurrence of different substrate types (e.g. sand ripples / \nflat sand / steps) or these scattered benthic organisms. These organisms occurred on all \ndifferent substrate ‘types’. \n \nSmall bony fishes were seen on occasion, usually quickly moving out of the field of view of \nthe ROV but were not identified for this assessment.  \n \nBioturbation of the seafloor in the form of small mounds, craters and thin trails was seen \nalong the entire length of the transect indicating the presence of mobile organisms living \non and within the seabed.  \nA summary of the habitat characteristics, flora and fauna recorded in Area 1b is provided in Table \n3-2. This table also provides the CATAMI Species Codes for each seafloor feature and taxa \nidentified. \nThe benthic habitat in the location where the transect crossed the pipeline route (as per the time \nstamp provided by Neptune) is shown in Figure 3-3 and consists of 3D rippled sand with a small \namount of biologenic gravel.  \nA map showing the location of the transect in Area 1b in relation to bathymetry and the KEF, along \nwith some georeferenced representative images of benthic habitat, is provided in Figure 3-4.

High \ndensity aggregations were often found in areas which had a high cover of biologenic \ngravel, but were not limited to these areas, also being found where the sediment appeared \nto be quite fine and where no biologenic gravel was obvious. This benthic fauna comprised \na diverse array of sponges and soft corals with varying forms, sizes and colours (refer to \nlength. Further details of taxa present and CATAMI codes are provided in Table 3-4.  \n \nFish fauna diversity was quite high, and varying sizes of fish were seen amongst the \naggregations of corals and sponges and over bare sandy seafloor.

This zone contains a significant volume of the overall in situ volume to be dredged, and there are many \nshallow locales where strong tidal flows both inhibit settlement of fine suspended sediments and stimulate \nsignificant levels of resuspension of sediments deposited after initial release in the water column. For \nScenarios 1A and 2A, where the offshore borrow ground is dredged for backfill material, an additional plume \nsignature results from recurrent elevations of near-seabed SSC north of Legendre Island and subsequent \nresuspension of this material as it is transported towards Nickol Bay. \nConcentrations of suspended sediment in the key activity areas will represent the combined influence of new \ndischarges and resuspension of fine sediments from earlier discharges. Temporal variations in intensity of the \ndredging operations, including overlap of multiple operations in time or downtime periods, will also influence \nturbidity peaks and troughs. At progressively more distant areas, the importance of resuspension as a \ncontributor to the distribution of SSC concentrations in general, and near-seabed concentrations in particular, \nbecomes a greater factor. The areas forecast to receive elevated concentrations are substantially larger than \nwould be affected by plumes only from the initial sources. The plume extents tend to expand over periods of \nseveral weeks in the direction of net drift, indicating the progressive transport of fine sediments through \ncontinuous patterns of settlement and resuspension. \nWith the duration of each scenario (ten months) spanning almost the entire range of seasonal conditions, the \ndirection of net drift will shift from summertime trends (generally longshore in a north-easterly direction) to \nwintertime trends (generally longshore in a south-westerly direction), or vice versa, depending on \ncommencement times (winter for Scenarios 1A/1B and summer for Scenarios 2A/2B). A progressive shift in \nthe available source of resuspendable fine sediments is also indicated. Periodic high wave-energy events will \nbe a major contributor to estimates of high SSC in the near-seabed layer, particularly in shallow exposed areas. \nWhile these processes are forecast to extend the influence of dredging activities over a wider area, the \nlongshore dispersal of finer sediments is indicated to be an important mechanism for limiting the trapping and \nbuild-up of fine sediments in the local region around the key activity areas. The build-up of resuspendable fine \nsediments in areas remote from dredging activities indicates that the supply of fines to these areas will be \ngreater than their removal due to ongoing resuspension and longshore transport, for as long as sediment input \nfrom dredging activities continues. \n5.1.2 Pipeline Dredging Activities \nFor pipeline dredging activities during winter conditions (Scenarios 1A and 1B), sediment plumes at low \nconcentrations are forecast to drift generally towards the south-west. The plumes tend to follow the bathymetric \ncontours between East Intercourse Island and East Lewis Island, and also between West Lewis Island and \nRosemary Island. \nIn contrast, the net drift direction forecast for sediment plumes from pipeline dredging activities during summer \nconditions (Scenarios 2A and 2B) is towards the north-east, with the plumes following the bathymetric contours \nas they turn around Legendre Island towards Delambre Island. This drift is imposed by the prevailing south-\nwesterly winds over the summer season. In general, the majority of the dispersing suspended material is \nforecast to migrate offshore rather than through Flying Foam Passage and Searipple Passage, which is \nattributable to the local bathymetric features. Much of the dredging occurs in water depths greater than that \nfound within each passage, but strong tidal currents will drive significant sediment concentrations in and out \nof the passages on a regular basis. \n5.1.3 Pipeline Backfill Activities \nFor the scenarios in which backfilling of the pipeline is facilitated by dredging of the inshore borrow ground \n(Scenarios 1B and 2B), the net drift direction of sediment plumes tends to be in opposition to that observed for \nthe plumes attributable to pipeline dredging activities. This is because a gap of several months has been \n--- Page 953 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 57 \nassumed between pipeline dredging and backfilling operations (see Section 3.5.5), meaning that the seasonal \ntrend has reversed over time. Because similar loss rates are applied during both the pipeline dredging and \nbackfilling phases, the contribution of sediment suspended by dredging at the inshore borrow ground to the \noverall plume footprint will be significant; the volume of backfill material to be dredged (~1.6 Mm3) is \ncomparable to that required to be dredged over the entire pipeline length (~1.9 Mm3), but is confined to a \nrelatively small area. Suspended sediments resulting from placement of the backfill material along the pipeline \nwill be concentrated near the seabed and will quickly settle due to the relative coarseness of the material. \nFor the scenarios in which backfilling of the pipeline is facilitated by dredging of the offshore borrow ground \n(Scenarios 1A and 2A), the bulk of the sediment suspended by dredging is forecast to be dispersed in the \noffshore area between the borrow ground and Legendre Island in both seasons. Strong tidal flows between \nHauy Island and Delambre Island will aid movement of sediment towards the shallow waters of Nickol Bay, \nwith this effect being greater during summer (Scenario 1A, following pipeline dredging activities in winter) due \nto predominant net drift towards the east imposed by prevailing south-westerly winds. In contrast, the net drift \ndirection forecast during winter conditions (Scenario 2A) is towards the south-west, mostly following the \nbathymetric contours to the north of Rosemary Island. The sediment plume from operations in this area is \nforecast to migrate to the offshore pipeline and spoil ground areas, most noticeably in Scenario 2A when \nborrow ground dredging occurs in winter (following pipeline dredging activities in summer) but at lower \nconcentrations than will have already occurred during pipeline dredging activities. \n \n--- Page 954 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 58 \n \n5.1.4 Spatial Outcomes \n5.1.4.1 Scenario 1A: Dredging Operations Commencing during Winter, with Backfill Material Sourced from Borrow \nGround A (Offshore) \n \n \n--- Page 955 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 59 \n \n \n \nPredicted 80th percentile dredge-excess SSC throughout the entire scenario duration (1st July 2016 to 30th April 2017). \n \n \n--- Page 956 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 60 \n \n \n \nPredicted 95th percentile dredge-excess SSC throughout the entire scenario duration (1st July 2016 to 30th April 2017). \n \n \n--- Page 957 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 61 \n \n \n5.1.4.2 Scenario 1B: Dredging Operations Commencing during Winter, with Backfill Material Sourced from Borrow \nGround B (Inshore) \n \n \n--- Page 958 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 62 \n \n \n \nPredicted 80th percentile dredge-excess SSC throughout the entire scenario duration (1st July 2016 to 30th April 2017). \n \n \n--- Page 959 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 63 \n \n \n \nPredicted 95th percentile dredge-excess SSC throughout the entire scenario duration (1st July 2016 to 30th April 2017). \n \n \n--- Page 960 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 64 \n \n \n5.1.4.3 Scenario 2A: Dredging Operations Commencing during Summer, with Backfill Material Sourced from Borrow \nGround A (Offshore) \n \n \n--- Page 961 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 65 \n \n \n \nPredicted 80th percentile dredge-excess SSC throughout the entire scenario duration (1st January 2017 to 31st October 2017). \n \n \n--- Page 962 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 66 \n \n \n \nPredicted 95th percentile dredge-excess SSC throughout the entire scenario duration (1st January 2017 to 31st October 2017). \n \n \n--- Page 963 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 67 \n \n \n5.1.4.4 Scenario 2B: Dredging Operations Commencing during Summer, with Backfill Material Sourced from Borrow \nGround B (Inshore) \n \n \n--- Page 964 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 68 \n \n \n \nPredicted 80th percentile dredge-excess SSC throughout the entire scenario duration (1st January 2017 to 31st October 2017). \n \n \n--- Page 965 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 69 \n \n \n \nPredicted 95th percentile dredge-excess SSC throughout the entire scenario duration (1st January 2017 to 31st October 2017). \n \n--- Page 966 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 70 \n5.2 \nPredictions of Management Zone Extents \n5.2.1 Summary \nentire program of dredging, disposal and backfill operations are listed in Table 5.1 for each scenario. \nPresentation of the ZoI areas is done on the basis of 95th percentile threshold exceedances for the 24-hour \nrolling average data. \nIt should be noted that the indicated management zone extents in each case represent a cumulative measure \nof exceedances of the relevant thresholds over a ten-month period, following the threshold criteria described \nin Section 4. They do not represent an instantaneous plume footprint at any point in time. \nThe indicated areas of threshold exceedances are largely a reflection of the areas of sediment confluence due \nto the proximity to key activity areas, where there is a sustained input of suspended sediments over periods of \nseveral months, and the influence of local metocean conditions acting to inhibit rates of settling and increase \nrates of resuspension. \nThe ZoI extents in ecological Zones A and B are broadly similar in all scenarios. In the Offshore ecological \nzone, a significantly larger ZoI is forecast along the pipeline in the vicinity of spoil grounds 2B and 5A for \nScenarios 1A and 1B (where pipeline dredging operations will occur during winter) than for Scenarios 2A and \n2B (where these operations will occur during summer). This is largely a consequence of the lower thresholds \napplicable during the winter period, and consequently the lower levels of dredge-excess SSC required to cause \nexceedances. In a similar manner, the larger ZoI predicted at the offshore borrow ground for Scenario 2A \n(where, following project commencement in summer, pipeline backfill operations will occur during winter) than \nfor Scenario 1A (where these operations will occur during summer) is attributable to the lower winter \nthresholds. \nThe ZoMI/ZoHI threshold exceedances in isolated pockets of King Bay and around the Intercourse Islands \nmay be attributable to the combined effects of model bathymetry and hydrodynamics, representing sediments \nthat are transported into the shallowest-possible grid cells and then “trapped” upon reversal of the tide. While \nit is clear that there is a potential for dredged sediments to be found in the indicated areas, the persistently \nhigh concentrations at the water-land boundaries may be overstated – particularly in light of the long durations \nrequired to trigger the ZoMI/ZoHI thresholds. \n \n \n--- Page 967 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion

These facilities are proposed to be connected to the mainland through an \napproximately 430 km trunkline to an onshore facility.  \nInstallation of the trunkline will involve pre-lay dredging and pipelay, followed by post-lay backfill \nwithin a Trunkline Project Area. Backfill material will be dredged from a separate area, the Borrow \nGrounds Project Area. Specialised vessels will be utilized for specific activities. \nThe Trunkline and Borrow Grounds Project Areas overlap, and are in proximity to, areas designated as \nBiologically Important Areas (BIAs) and habitat critical for the survival of a species (‘habitat critical’) \nfor marine turtles. The Recovery Plan for Marine Turtles in Australia 2017-2027 (the ‘Recovery Plan’) \n(Commonwealth of Australia, 2017) identifies light pollution as high risk threat to marine turtles in the \nNorth West Shelf (NWS) region. \nimpact assessment to support demonstration that the received levels of light within BIAs and habitat \ncritical (including nesting beaches) associated with trunkline installation and borrow ground activities \nwill be of an acceptable level and managed consistently with the Recovery Plan. \n1.1 \nExclusions \n \nThis report assesses the potential impacts of activities undertaken in Commonwealth waters \nonly. \n \nThis report assesses the impacts of artificial light on marine turtles only, no other receptors \nare considered. \n--- Page 1017 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n2 | P a g e  \n2 \nBACKGROUND \n2.1 \nProject Description \nActivities associated with the trunkline installation within 20 km of land are summarised in Table 2-1. \nThe main activities of trunkline trenching, pipelay and backfill are required to be completed \nsequentially and will not occur concurrently. Of the vessels described in Table 2-1, the TSHD and \npipelay vessels have the greatest potential for light emissions based on their size. Although an \napproximate schedule for activities is available, start dates are estimates only and are subject to \nchange. Therefore, for the purpose of this report it is assumed that the activities below could occur at \nany time of year.  \nAll activities will be undertaken in the Trunkline Project Area with the exception of dredging activities \nin the Borrow Grounds Project Area. The dredging will involve removal of sand from the borrow \ngrounds to be transported to the trunkline for backfill.  \nwithin 20 km of land \nActivity \nEstimated duration \nLocation \nVessels \nHydrographic, \ngeophysical and \ngeotechnical \nsurveys \n2 months \n \nVessel continuously present within project \nareas and constantly moving \nTrunkline and \nBorrow Grounds \nProject Areas \nSurvey vessels \nPre-lay trenching \nand spoil disposal \n8 weeks \n \nVessel continuously present within project \nareas and constantly moving \nTrunkline Project \nArea \nTrailing suction hopper \ndredger (TSHD) \nPipelay  \n3.5 weeks \n \nVessel continuously present within project \nareas and constantly moving \nTrunkline Project \nArea \nPipelay vessel (largest vessel), \nplus: \n \nB-type bulk carrier  \nOR \n \n1 - 2 primary support \nvessels \n \nGeneral Supply Vessels \nPre- and post-lay \nspan rectification \n2 weeks \n \nIntermittent activity: \nActivities at individual location ~48 hours \nTrunkline Project \nArea \nConstruction Vessel  \nPost-lay dredging \nand backfill \n \n8 weeks \n \nIntermittent cyclical activity: \n2 hours dredging ion borrow grounds, \nmaterial transported to trunkline for \nbackfill.

Where direct light falls upon a surface, be it land or ocean, this area of \nlight is referred to as light spill. Sky glow is the diffuse glow caused by light that is screened from view \nbut through reflection and refraction creates a glow in the atmosphere. Scattering of light by dust, salt \nand other atmospheric aerosols increases the visibility of light as sky glow, while the presence of \nclouds reflecting light back to earth can substantially illuminate the landscape (Kyba et al., 2011). \nWhite/blue light scatters more easily and further in the atmosphere compared to yellow-orange light \n(Kyba et al., 2011). Therefore, the distance at which direct light and sky glow may be visible from the \nsource is dependent on the number, intensity and types of lights, and how such lights are orientated \nor shielded, in addition to environmental conditions. \nExisting light sources at the eastern end of the Trunkline Project Area (within 20 km of land) include \nheavy vessel traffic within the Pilbara Port Authority Management area and 26 designated anchorages \nfor bulk carriers, petroleum and gas tankers, drilling rigs, offshore platforms, and pipelay vessels \nlocated offshore of Rosemary Island. These anchorages are located between Rosemary Island and the \nTrunkline Project Area (Figure 2-1). Although light monitoring within the Dampier Archipelago has not \nbeen undertaken, existing light pollution in this area is expected. \nAs described in Section 2.1, the TSHD and pipelay vessels have the greatest potential for light \nemissions based on size. In absence of representative light monitoring or modelling, or the required \nlevel of detail to allow meaningful comparison to existing information, it is assumed for this \nassessment that received light intensity within 20 km of the Project Areas may result in impacts to \nmarine turtle behaviour. A 20 km buffer was selected based on recommendations proposed in the \nNational Light Pollution Guidelines for Wildlife (Commonwealth of Australia, 2020; and references \ntherein).  \n2.3 \nRelevant Marine Turtle Species \nFive species of marine turtle may occur in the Trunkline and Borrow Grounds Project Areas: flatback \n(Natator depressus), green (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), loggerhead (Caretta \ncaretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles.  \nAlthough CALM (1990) reports loggerhead turtle nesting activity on Cohen Island, Pendoley et al. \n(2016) did not find any evidence of loggerhead nesting activity in over 20 years of track data. The \nnorthernmost key loggerhead nesting areas include the North West Cape and Muiron Islands and any \nnesting activity by loggerhead turtles in the Dampier Archipelago will not represent significant \nrookeries for this species. No major leatherback turtle rookeries are known to occur in Australia, with \nscattered nesting reported in Queensland (Limpus & MacLachlan, 1979, 1994; Limpus et al., 1984) and \nthe Northern Territory (Hamann et al., 2006; Limpus & MacLachlan, 1994) only. As such, loggerhead \nand leatherback turtles are not considered further. \nMarine turtles in Australia belong to discrete genetic stocks, within each species, that are defined by \nthe presence of regional breeding aggregations. Marine turtles breeding in the vicinity of the activities \nbelong to the Green North West Shelf (G-NWS), Flatback – Pilbara (F-Pil) and Hawksbill – Western \n--- Page 1019 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n4 | P a g e  \nAustralia (H-WA) genetic stocks.  The Recovery Plan provides information for each stock which is \nsummarised below: \n \nGreen turtles: The trend for the G-NWS stock is reported as stable. Important nesting areas \ninclude the Montebello Islands (major), and Rosemary Island, Legendre Island and Delambre \nIsland (minor).  \n \nFlatback turtles: The trend of the F-Pil genetic stock is currently unknown. Important nesting \nareas include Delambre Island (major), and the Montebello Islands and Dampier Archipelago \n(minor).  \n \nHawksbill turtles: The trend for the H-WA stock is also unknown. Rosemary Island, Delambre \nIsland and the Dampier Archipelago are all listed as major important nesting areas for this \nhawksbill stock.  \n \nLight pollution was assessed as a high-risk threat to all three genetic stocks (green, G-NWS; \nflatback, F-Pil; hawksbill, H-WA).   \n2.3.1 Life Cycle \nIn general, marine turtle species share a very similar life cycle pattern.  During non-breeding, adults of \nboth sexes, and sexually immature juveniles, inhabit open ocean foraging habitat. Breeding adults \nthen undergo a breeding migration from foraging areas to mating areas, which may or may not be \nclose to the nesting beach (Miller, 1996).  After mating, the males return to the foraging areas while \nthe females will spend several months in internesting habitat in proximity to nesting beaches.  Females \ntypically demonstrate strong site fidelity, laying each of their clutches on the same group of beaches \nor island.  As capital breeders, marine turtles are understood to show inactive behaviour during the \ninternesting period (the period between a successful clutch and the next nesting attempt) (Hays et al., \n1999, Fossette et al., 2012), presumably to conserve energy for successive reproductive events (see \nHays et al., 1999).  Once the last clutch of eggs is laid, females will return to the foraging areas, building \nup their fat reserves before the next breeding migration. Most females will not nest in consecutive \nyears (Miller, 1996).   \nHatchlings emerge from the nest and orient towards the sea using the low elevation light horizon \n(Witherington & Bjorndal, 1991).  After entering the water, hatchlings use a combination of cues (wave \ndirection and currents) to orient and travel into deeper offshore waters (Lohmann & Lohmann, 1992; \nWilson et al., 2018; Wilson et al., submitted). Crossing and swimming away from the beach is thought \nto imprint the hatchlings with the cues that allow individuals to return to their natal region to breed \nas adults (Lohmann et al., 1997). Hatchlings do not feed for the first few days of life, relying on the \nremains of internalised yolk resources (Witherington, 1991). In general, hatchlings disperse into \noceanic currents and gyres where they will stay in these pelagic environments (the pelagic juvenile \nstage) until large enough to settle in coastal feeding habitats (Boyle et al., 2009; Car, 1987; \nWitherington, 1991). Flatback turtles have a slightly different life cycle to this generalised life cycle, as \nthey do not have a pelagic phase. Juveniles grow to maturity in shallow coastal waters, thought to be \nclose to their natal beaches (Musick & Limpus, 1996).  \n--- Page 1020 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n5 | P a g e  \n2.3.2 Habitat use \nThe Recovery Plan identifies BIAs and habitat critical for flatback, hawksbill and green turtles. Areas \noverlapping the Trunkline and Borrow Grounds Project Areas include:  \n \nFlatback turtle internesting BIA (80 km) around the Montebello Islands and Dampier \nArchipelago. \n \nGreen turtle internesting BIA (20 km) around the Dampier Archipelago. \n \nHawksbill turtle internesting BIA (20 km) around the Dampier Archipelago. \n \nFlatback turtle internesting habitat critical (60 km) around the Montebello Islands and \nDampier Archipelago. \nNesting areas identified as habitat critical for flatback, green and hawksbill turtles in the vicinity of the \nProject Areas include: \n \nGreen turtle: Montebello Islands (all with sandy beaches) and Dampier Archipelago. \n \nFlatback turtle: Montebello Islands, Dampier Archipelago (including Delambre Island and Huay \nIsland [adjacent to Legendre Island]). \n \nHawksbill turtle: Dampier Archipelago (including Rosemary Island and Delambre Island) and \nMontebello Islands (including Ah Chong Island, South East Island and Trimouille Island). \nTurtle nesting activity has been observed on a number of islands of the Dampier Archipelago, as \nsummarised in Table 2-2 and shown in Figure 2-1 (CALM, 1990; Pendoley et al., 2016). Islands that \ncould occur within 20 km of the Project Areas are indicated in Table 2-2. The Montebello Islands also \nhave important nesting beaches for flatback, green and hawksbill turtles (Pendoley et al., 2016).  \nWithin the Dampier Archipelago, Rosemary Island has the most significant nesting beaches, \ndetermined as mean number of hawksbill, green and flatback turtle tracks per day (Pendoley et al., \n2016) and is recognised as an internationally significant rookery for hawksbill turtles (Limpus, 2009). \nOn Rosemary Island, the majority of hawksbill nesting occurs on the north-western (NW) beaches (K. \nPendoley, pers. comm.) with lower density flatback and green nesting occurring at beaches on the \neast of the island. An analysis of turtle track data from these beaches on Rosemary Island between \n1990 and 2017 has been undertaken (Whiting, 2018), whichconcluded that nest counts were \ndominated by hawksbill turtles (9860 nesting events, or 92.1%), with lower flatback and green nests \ncounts at 366 (3.4%) and 478 (4.5%), respectively. These results corroborate other conclusions that \nthe nesting population of hawksbill turtles at Rosemary Island is one of the largest populations in \nAustralia and globally (Limpus, 2009). \nOther islands also with moderate nesting activity (11 – 100 tracks per day) for all three species, include \nDelambre Island, Enderby Island and Eaglehawk Island (Pendoley et al., 2016). Although track data \nconfirmed presence of flatback turtles only at Legendre Island (Pendoley et al., 2016), a tagging \nprogram conducted in 2008 demonstrated that flatbacks, hawksbill and green turtles nested in \nnotable numbers at this island (Biota, 2009). Delambre Island has been recognised as the largest \nflatback turtle rookery in Australia with an estimated 3500 nesting females per year (Chaloupka, \n--- Page 1021 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n6 | P a g e  \n2018). Track counts at Angel Island also demonstrate low nesting activity of hawksbill turtles and \nrecords of flatback turtle nesting. No additional published information regarding turtle nesting on \nAngel Island is available. \nSeasonality of nesting differs between flatback, green and hawksbill turtles; Table 2-3 outlines the \ngeneralised seasonality across the NWS region. Whiting (2018) provides defined seasonality specific \nnesting data for Rosemary Island (indicated in Table 2-3 by *) and found that hawksbill turtles have a \nmuch earlier peak (October/November) compared to flatback turtles (December/January peak). \nSeasonality for green turtles was not well defined from the available data (Whiting, 2018). Given the \ndiscrete duration of surveys at Legendre Island (Biota, 2009), insufficient data is available to refine \nseasonality for this location.  \nof the Dampier Archipelago (CALM, 1990; Pendoley et al., 2016; Biota, 2009) \nAngel \nBurrup Peninsula \nConzinc \nDelambre \nDolphin \nEaglehawk \nEast Goodwyn \nEast Intercourse \nElphick Nob \nEnderby \nHauy \nIntercourse \nKeast \nLady Nora \nLegendre \nRosemary \nWest Intercourse \nWest Mid Intercourse \nTrunkline \nProject Area \ndistance \n(km) \n17 \n22 \n22 \n38 \n17 \n41 \n25 \n32 \n14 \n27 \n27 \n34 \n13 \n12 \n12 \n14 \n36 \n35 \nBorrow \nground \nProject Area \ndistance \n(km) \n21 \n26 \n28 \n20 \n16 \n57 \n41 \n42 \n32 \n43 \n14 \n45 \n10 \n28 \n6.6 \n40 \n48 \n46 \nFlatback \nX \nX \nX \nM \nX \nL \nX \nX \nX \nM \nX \nX \nX \nX \nL \nM \nX \nX \nGreen \n- \nX \n- \nL \nX \nL \n- \nX \n- \nL \nX \n- \n- \n- \nX \nM \nX \n- \nHawksbill \nL \n- \n- \nL \n- \nL \nX \n- \nX \nM \n- \n- \n- \n- \nX \nH \n- \n- \nKey \n \nIsland is within 20 km of the Project Areas plus nesting at ‘Low’ or above \n \nIsland is within 20 km of the Project Areas, but nesting is less than ‘Low’ \n \nIsland is more than 20 km from Project Areas \n- \nAbsent \nX \nPresent  \nL \nLow: 1 – 10 tracks per day \nM \nModerate: 11 – 100 tracks per day \nH \nHigh: 101 – 500 tracks per day \n \n \n \n--- Page 1022 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n7 | P a g e  \nturtles in the North West Shelf region. \nSpecies \nActivity \nJul \nAug \nSep \nOct \nNov \nDec \nJan \nFeb \nMar \nApr \nMay \nJun \nGreen \nNesting \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEmergence \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHawksbill \nNesting \n \n \n \n*\n*\n*\n*\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEmergence \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*\n*\n*\n*\n \n \n \n \nFlatback \nNesting \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*\n*\n*\n*\n \n \n \n \nEmergence \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*\n*\n*\n*\n*Peak nesting reported for Rosemary Island (Whiting, 2018), peak hatchling emergence based on ~two month \nincubation (Commonwealth of Australia, 2017) \nAlthough the body of literature describing marine turtle movement patterns during the breeding \nseason is increasing, information specific to the Dampier Archipelago is more limited. Pendoley (2005) \nprovides details of tracking data for green and hawksbill turtles nesting on Rosemary Island. Results \nsuggested that nesting female hawksbill turtles remained within 1 km of nesting beaches on Rosemary \nIsland (Pendoley, 2005). Female green turtles travelled greater distances, up to 5 km, but typically \nremained within shallow, nearshore waters between 0 and 10 m deep (Pendoley, 2005). Studies on \nthe movements of internesting flatback turtles nesting within the Dampier Archipelago are lacking. \nHowever, an exhaustive analysis of a large dataset of satellite tracking data showed that flatback \nfemales remained in water depths of <44 m and favoured a mean depth of <10 m (Whittock et al., \n2016a). Flatback turtles generally demonstrate internesting displacement distances of 3.4 – 62 km \nfrom the nesting beach, typically confined to longshore movements in nearshore coastal waters or \ntravelling between island rookeries and the adjacent mainland (Whittock et al., 2014). There is no \nevidence to date to indicate that flatback turtles swim out into deep offshore waters during the \ninternesting period. Incorporating tracking data, along with environmental variables, into a habitat \nsuitability model, Whittock et al., (2016) defined suitable internesting habitat as water 0 – 16 m deep \nand within 5 – 10 km of the coastline, while unsuitable internesting habitat was defined as water >25 \nm deep and >27 km from the coastline (Whittock et al., 2016a).  \nBased on this understanding, it is considered unlikely that internesting turtles will occur in the \nTrunkline Project Area around the Montebello Islands where water depths range from 46 m to 214 m. \nAt the shallowest point, which is in water adjacent to the Dampier Archipelago, water depths in the \nTrunkline Project Area are approximately 30 m. Water depths of the Borrow Grounds Project Area \nrange between approximately ’30 to 40 m. Internesting green and hawksbill turtles are unlikely to \nutilise habitat at these water depths. Flatback turtles nesting on beaches of the Dampier Archipelago \nmay internest in the shallower waters of the Trunkline Project Area and Borrow Grounds Project Area, \nhowever, large numbers are not expected. \nFollowing incubation, hatchlings emerge from the sand, crawl to the ocean and swim offshore, in a \nbehaviour termed the “swim frenzy”, under the influence of tides and currents before reaching \ndeeper, less predator rich, waters. This offshore migration occurs in the top 30 cm of the ocean and \nthis swimming behaviour is regularly interrupted by rest periods when hatchlings float on or near \nseaweed at the sea surface (Duran & Dunbar, 2015, Bell et al., 2016). Current data for the Project Area \nat the closest point to the Montebello Islands and islands of the Dampier Archipelago are presented \nin RPS (2019). Estimates of the net currents were derived by combining predictions of the drift \ncurrents, available from mesoscale ocean models, with estimates of the tidal currents (RPS, 2019).  \n--- Page 1023 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n8 | P a g e  \nDuring peak hatchling season (November to April, inclusive of all species) currents at the Montebello \nIslands location flow in a westerly direction. Current speed ranged between <0.1 to 0.5 m/s-1 with the \ngreatest proportion of records within the 0.1 – 0.2 m/s-1 range. At the Dampier Archipelago location, \ncurrents were predominantly in a northeast (NE) direction over the same time period. Current speed \nranged from <0.04 to 0.16 m/s-1 (RPS, 2019). When modelled to include tidal influences incorporated, \ncurrent speed at the Dampier Archipelago location increased to range between <0.1 – 0.5 m/s-1 and \nwere predominantly in a west (W) or east (E) direction.  Tidal influences had less of an effect on current \nspeed at the Montebello Islands location, although the proportion of current speeds recorded in the \n0.4 – 0.5 m/s-1 range increased. Currents in an easterly direction were also as dominant as those in a \nwesterly direction (RPS, 2019). \nNon-breeding habitat use may include migratory pathways (adults) or foraging areas (adults and \npelagic juveniles) for loggerhead, green, hawksbill, leatherback and flatback turtles. During non-\nbreeding, green turtles typically occupy nearshore, coastal bays, feeding on seagrasses and \nmacroalgae (Bjorndal, 1997; Bolten, 2003). They are herbivorous for the majority of their life history; \nhowever, post-hatching green turtles are omnivorous in their pelagic stage, and recent findings point \nto an oceanic diet including sea jellies for some populations (Arthur et al., 2008; Bolten, 2003). Flipper \ntagging data suggest WA waters are probable foraging grounds for green turtles that nest not only in \nWA, but also the Northern Territory and Indonesia (Prince, 1997). Flatback turtle foraging areas have \nbeen found to occur in waters shallower than 130 m and within 315 km of the shore, with many areas \nlocated in 50 m water depth and 66 km from shore (Whittock et al., 2016b). Their main diet comprises \nalgae, squid, invertebrates, and molluscs. Loggerheads feed on benthic invertebrates including \nmolluscs and crustaceans (Shigenaka, 2003).  Loggerhead turtles are a nearshore species who prefer \nwarm, shallow continental shelves and coastal bays and estuaries (Shigenaka, 2003). Hawksbill turtles \nare the most tropical of all sea turtle species and are found within rock and reef habitats, coastal areas \nand lagoons. They are known to forage amongst vertical underwater cliffs, on coral reefs and on \ngorgonian (soft coral) flats, as well as seagrass or algae meadows (Bjorndal, 1996). Hawksbills feed \nprimarily on sponges, but will also consume shrimp, squid, anemones, algae, seagrass, sea cucumber \nand soft corals (Bjorndal, 1996).  \nBenthic surveys of the trunkline route between the State waters boundary and approximately \nkilometre point (KP) 50, to determine the presence and extent of any sessile benthic assemblages \nadjacent to the proposed trunkline route, found that the seabed was characterised as fine to coarse \nsand with low species abundance and diversity with sparse sponges and soft corals typical of habitat \non the NWS (Woodside, 2009). Benthic habitat surveys within the Borrow Grounds Project Area \nsuggested that the benthic habitat is dominated by sandy bottom and with little to no biota (Advisian, \n2019). Based on the key food sources of marine turtle species, and the relative abundance of epifauna \nand infauna found in the Trunkline and Borrow Grounds Project Areas, the trunkline and borrow \ngrounds are unlikely to support foraging aggregations of marine turtles. \nTracking data has highlighted the importance of the Dampier Archipelago for both green and hawksbill \nturtles on migration, though tracks indicated individuals stayed outside the furthermost islands of the \nArchipelago, and the eastern side of the Burrup Peninsula (Pendoley, 2005). The tracking data from \nPendoley (2005) did not identify any foraging grounds for greens and hawksbills within the Dampier \nArchipelago.  However, foraging aggregations of unidentified marine turtles during a mid-winter aerial \n--- Page 1024 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n9 | P a g e  \nmarine fauna survey of the NWS region were concentrated in warm shallow waters off the offshore \nislands (Prince, 2001).   \n--- Page 1025 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n10 | P a g e  \n \n--- Page 1026 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n11 | P a g e  \n3 \nIMPACT ASSESSMENT \n3.1 \nRationale \nAs described in Section 2.2, this impact assessment assumes that received light intensity at nesting \nbeaches within 20 km of the Project Area may result in impacts to marine turtle behaviour at these \nnesting beaches (Figure 2-1). The assessment is focused upon islands which have recorded at least 1 \n– 10 tracks per day (i.e low or above low activity) for either flatback, hawksbill or green turtles, as \nsummarised in Table 2-2. These islands include Rosemary Island (14 km south (S) of the Trunkline \nProject Area), Legendre Island (12 km E of the Trunkline Project Area and 6.5 km S of the Borrow \nGrounds Project Area), and Angel Island (17 km southeast (SE) of the Trunkline Project Area). Although \nDelambre Island is located 20 km SE of the Borrow Grounds Project Area, the area within 20 km \ncomprises rocky coastline unsuitable for turtle nesting. The sandy beaches where turtle nesting will \noccur at higher density are located more than 20 km from the Project Area. Therefore, potential \nimpacts to nesting habitat of Delambre Island are not considered further. \nAlthough the Project Areas are located in a general offshore direction from the islands listed above, \nvariations in the coastline exist such that, at an individual beach level, the orientation of the vessels \nfrom individual nesting turtles may not always be in an offshore direction. Furthermore, as the vessels \ntraverse through the Project Areas, the relative orientation to nesting beaches will change. Figure 3-1 \npresents the relative orientation of the Project Area from three nesting beaches on Rosemary Island, \nand one from Legendre Island. A generalised representation of unfavourable orientation of the Project \nAreas to these beaches was based on angles either less than 45°, or more than 135°, assuming that \n90° was the most direct line to the ocean. The portions of the Project Areas that are considered to be \nat an unfavourable orientation to the nesting beaches are shown in red hatching. These hatched areas \nrepresent an area of increased vulnerability to behavioural impacts due to artificial light as a \nvisualisation tool only; they do not constitute a definitive threshold at which an impact will or will not \noccur. Factors such as the aspect, including the location of individual nests/clutches on the beach, and \nsurrounding topography, will all influence the vulnerability of individual turtles to behavioural impacts. \nThe majority of hawksbill nesting on Rosemary Island occurs on the west coast, while lower density \nnesting occurs on NE and E facing beaches (Whiting, 2018; K. Pendoley, pers. comm.). The portion of \nthe Project Area that occurs within 20 km of Rosemary Island includes an area which ranges in \norientation from north-northwest (NNW) to northeast (NE), resulting in potentially unfavourable \norientations presented in Figure 3-1. Legendre Island runs on a northwest (NW) to SE axis; turtle \nnesting beaches are predominantly found on the NE and southwest (SW) coasts of the eastern half of \nthe island (Biota, 2009; K. Pendoley, pers. comm.). The orientation of the Trunkline Project Area to \nLegendre Island ranges from E to NE and the orientation of the borrow grounds Project Area to \nLegendre Island range from NNW to north (N). Given the combination of distance and orientation, \nrelatively small proportions of either the borrow grounds or Trunkline Project Areas overlap with areas \nof potentially unfavourable orientation (Figure 3-1). Nesting beaches on Angel Island face in a NW \ndirection, with orientation of the Trunkline Project Area in a NNW direction.  \nAlthough the TSHD or pipelay vessels may be consistently present in the Trunkline Project Area for up \nto eight weeks, depending on the activity being undertaken, the continual movement of the vessel \nwill prevent any one specific receptor (e.g. a particular nesting beach or an individual turtle) being \n--- Page 1027 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n12 | P a g e  \nexposed for the duration of each activity and is most likely limited to less than eight weeks, depending \non the nesting beach. Dredging activities in the Borrow Grounds, and backfill activities in the Trunkline \nProject Areas, will be undertaken intermittently; cycling between two hours in the borrow grounds \nfollowed by five hours in the Trunkline Project Area. \n \n--- Page 1028 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n13 | P a g e  \n \n--- Page 1029 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n14 | P a g e  \n3.1 \nNesting \nAdult female marine turtles return to land, predominantly at night, to nest on sandy beaches, relying \non visual cues to select, and orient on, nesting beaches. That artificial lighting on or near beaches has \nbeen shown to disrupt nesting behaviour is relatively well documented (see Witherington & Martin, \n2003 for review). Beaches with light spill, such as those located adjacent to urban developments, \nroadways and piers, often have lower densities of nesting females compared to beaches with less \ndevelopment (Salmon, 2003; Hu et al., 2018). Further, on completion of laying, nesting females are \nthought to use light cues in order to return to open ocean, orientating towards the brightest light \n(Witherington & Martin, 2003). However, observations of nesting females and emerging hatchlings at \nthe same beach showed that females were disorientated much less frequently than hatchlings \n(Witherington, 1992) indicating that nesting females are less vulnerable to impacts of artificial light on \nsea-finding. \nAlthough it is assumed that artificial light emitted from project vessels may be visible at nesting \nbeaches, given the distance between the light sources and the beaches (minimum of 6.5 km from \nBorrow ground and 12 km from Trunkline Project Area), direct light spill onto the beach is not \nconsidered credible. As such, the vessel light sources are not expected to discourage females from \nnesting, or effect nest site selection, and hence will not displace females from nesting habitat. There \nis a possibility that the orientation of light sources relative to individual nesting females returning to \nsea, may be in a longshore direction that could cause disruption to sea-finding behaviour. Although \nthe maximum duration of a pipelay or TSHD vessel activity is eight weeks (Table 2-1), these vessels are \neither continually moving (within the Trunkline Project Area) or have intermittent presence (in the \nBorrow Ground Project Area), and, therefore, the relative orientation between the vessel and an \nindividual beach will not occur for the duration of the activity. Intermittent activities are limited to a \nmaximum of five hours in the Trunkline Project Area or two hours in the Borrow Grounds Project Area. \nThe continuous movement, or intermittent presence, will unlikely result in the TSHD and pipelay vessel \nbeing located at an unfavourable orientation for the duration of the activity, limiting the number of \nfemales at risk to an insignificant proportion of the nesting population. Since females are not \nconsidered highly vulnerable to disorientation due to artificial light, the risk of artificial light preventing \nnesting behaviour at nesting beaches is considered low. \n3.2 \nMating, Internesting, Foraging and Migration \nThe Project Areas overlap habitat critical (internesting buffers) and BIAs for the flatback turtle around \nthe Dampier Archipelago and Montebello Islands, and internesting BIAs for green and hawksbill turtles \naround the Dampier Archipelago (see Section 2.3). However, as described in Section 2.3.2, green and \nhawksbill internesting turtles showed preference for water depths less than 10 m and suitable flatback \nturtle internesting habitat is considered to be less than 25 m deep. \nMinimum water depths within the Project Areas are 32 m suggesting that the majority of flatback, \ngreen and hawksbill turtles are not expected to use waters within the Project Areas for internesting, \nalthough some individual turtles may be encountered. Individuals may migrate through the Project \nAreas, and although foraging aggregations have not been identified, individuals may forage in low \ndensities. No mating aggregations have been identified in the Project Areas. \n--- Page 1030 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n15 | P a g e  \nAlthough individuals undertaking internesting, migration, mating (adults) or foraging (adults and \npelagic juveniles) may occur within the Project Areas, marine turtles do not use light cues to guide \nthese behaviours. Further, there is no evidence, published or anecdotal, to suggest that internesting, \nmating, foraging or migrating turtles are impacted by light from offshore vessels. As such, light \nemissions from the vessels are unlikely to result in displacement of, or behavioural changes to, \nindividuals in these life stages. \n3.3 \nEmerging hatchlings \nHatchling turtles emerge from the nest, typically at night (Mrosovsky & Shettleworth, 1968), and must \nrapidly reach the ocean to avoid predation (Salmon, 2003). Hatchlings locate the ocean using a \ncombination of topographic and brightness cues, orienting towards the lower, brighter oceanic \nhorizon, and away from elevated darkened silhouettes of dunes and/or vegetation behind the beach \n(Pendoley & Kamrowski, 2015; Lohmann et al., 1997; Limpus & Kamrowski, 2013).  \nArtificial lights interfere with natural light levels and silhouettes, which disrupts hatchling sea-finding \nbehaviour (Withington & Martin, 2003; Pendoley & Kamrowski, 2015; Kamrowski, et al., 2014). \nHatchlings may become disorientated - where hatchlings crawl on circuitous paths; or become \nmisorientated - where they move in the wrong direction, possibly attracted to artificial lights \n(Withington & Martin, 2003; Lohmann et al., 1997; Salmon, 2003). Hatchling orientation has been \nshown to be disrupted by light produced at distances of up to 18 km from the nesting beach (Hodge \net al., 2007, Kamrowski et al., 2014), although the degree of impact will be influenced by a number of \nfactors including light intensity, visibility (a function of lamp orientation and shielding), spectral power \ndistribution (wavelength and colour), atmospheric scattering, cloud reflectance, spatial extent of sky \nglow, duration of exposure, horizon elevation and lunar phase. Hatchlings disoriented or misoriented \nby artificial lighting may take longer, or fail, to reach the sea. This may result in increased mortality \nthrough dehydration, predation or exhaustion (Salmon & Witherington, 1995).  \nStudies of hatchling sea-finding behaviour found that, on Curtis Island in Queensland, 20% of hatchling \nfans within proximity to artificial light associated with an onshore LNG plant had an offset bearing of \n>90°, indicating severe sea-finding disruption (Kamrowski et al., 2014). However, the number of \nindividual hatchlings that traversed the beach at bearings that indicated misorientation or \ndisorientation are not reported.  Although direct comparisons between light emissions of the \nproposed vessels and the LNG plant in this study are not possible (given the size of the LNG plant), it \nis considered credible that light emissions from the LNG plant will exceed those from the project \nvessels.  \nDisruption to orientation of emerging hatchlings has been found to occur most often during the new \nmoon phase and least frequent during full moon phases (Salmon & Witherington, 1995). Experiments \nshowed that background illumination from the moon (while in phases closer to full moon), restored \nnormal seafinding behaviour in hatchlings but did not result in attraction in the direction of the moon. \nIt was concluded that background illumination from the moon reduced light intensity gradients of \nartificial light, reducing, but not eliminating, its effect on hatchling orientation (Salmon & \nWitherington, 1995).  \nAlthough the Project Areas are located offshore, the orientation of vessels in relation to individual \nclutches at the local beach scale may occur in a longshore direction (as described above and presented \n--- Page 1031 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n16 | P a g e  \nin Figure 3-1) providing the potential for emerging hatchlings to become mis- or disorientated. \nHowever, the proportion of hatchlings that may become mis or disorientated is unlikely to comprise \na significant proportion of the total number of hatchlings emerging from nesting beaches for the \nfollowing reasons: \n \nSince the TSHD and pipelay vessels will be continually moving within the Trunkline Project \nArea, and the TSHD will only be intermittently present in the Borrow Grounds Project Area, \nvessels will only be temporarily (i.e. days to weeks) located at an orientation that could result \nin hatchling mis- or disorientation.  \n \nThe potential impact of artificial light may be reduced during the full moon period (Salmon & \nWitherington, 1995), further reducing the overall timeframe within which an impact could \noccur.  \n \nIt is not credible that all nests on a given beach will hatch during the activity duration (less \nthan eight weeks) given the length of the peak hatchling emergence season (Table 2-3), and \nconsidering the effects of moon phase (above), meaning that the number at risk of \nbehavioural impact will be less than the total number of hatchlings hatching on any given \nbeach.  \n \nEven if it is assumed that sea-finding is disrupted for all hatchlings in a given clutch, which is \nhighly unlikely (K. Pendoley, pers. comm.), the proportion of clutches that could demonstrate \nsea-finding disruption is expected to be less than 20% (assuming a lower probability of impact \ncompared to that reported in Kamrowski et al., (2014)). \nTherefore, should light emissions from the project vessels result in sea-finding disruption, it would \nlikely be limited to a small proportion of individual hatchlings, which is not expected to result in \nsignificant impacts to flatback, green or hawksbill turtles within important nesting areas in the \nDampier Archipelago and Montebello Islands (as defined in the Recovery Plan) or at the level of the \ngenetic stock. While disruption to the behaviour of a small number of hatchlings may occur, the \ntemporary presence of the light sources allows hatchling sea-finding behaviour to continue, once the \nvessel has moved away. Since the vessel activities are not planned to occur in multiple breeding \nseasons, such behavioural response are highly unlikely to result in impacts at a population level or \nresult in decreasing trends in nesting abundance. \n3.4 \nDispersing hatchlings \nOnce in nearshore waters, artificial lights on land can also interfere with the dispersal of hatchlings. \nPresence of artificial light can slow down their in-water dispersal (Witherington & Bjorndal, 1991; \nWilson et al., 2018) or increase their dispersion path, potentially depleting yolk reserves, or even \nattract hatchings back to shore (Truscott et al., 2017). In addition to interfering with swimming, \nartificial light can influence predation rates, with increased predation of hatchlings in areas with \nsignificant sky glow (Gyuris, 1994; Pilcher et al., 2000).  Since the nearshore area tends to be predator-\nrich, hatchling survival may depend on them exiting this area rapidly (Gyuris, 1994).  Should this be \nthe case, aggregation of predatory fish occurring in artificially lit areas (e.g. Wilson et al., 2019) may \nfurther increase predation of hatchlings. \n--- Page 1032 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n17 | P a g e  \nAn internal compass set while crawling down the beach, together with wave cues, are used to reliably \nguide hatchlings offshore (Lohmann & Lohmann, 1992, Stapput & Wiltschko, 2005; Wilson et al., \nsubmitted). In the absence of wave cues, however, swimming hatchlings have been shown to orient \ntowards light cues (Lorne & Salmon, 2007, Harewood & Horrocks, 2008) and in some cases, wave cues \nwere overridden by light cues (Thums et al., 2013, 2016; Wilson et al., 2018).  \nThe speed and direction of at-sea dispersal is substantially influenced by currents; the offshore \ntrajectory of flatback hatchlings at Thevenard Island was displaced by tidal currents that ran parallel \nto the beach, an effect that increased as the hatchlings moved further offshore (Wilson et al., 2018, \n2019). However, when light was present this effect was diminished, showing that hatchlings actively \nswam against currents and towards the light source, which slowed their offshore dispersal from 0.5 \nm/s-1 when no light was present, to 0.35 - 0.44 m/s-1, depending on the type of light (Wilson et al., \n2018).  Wilson et al. (2018) demonstrated that when flatback hatchlings were within 150 m of the \nbeach, they were able to swim against currents up to 0.3 m/s-1. \nThese results suggest that hatchlings can move in any direction when their swimming speed is greater \nthan the speed of the nearshore current, although the speed at which currents can no longer be \novercome by hatchlings will be species specific and related to swimming speeds.  The mean swimming \nof flatback hatchlings under natural light conditions (0.5 m/s-1) were similar to speeds of green turtle \nhatchlings (0.49 m/s-1) (Thums et al., 2016), both of which are greater that hawksbill turtle hatchlings \n(0.21 m/s-1) (Chung et al., 2009). Given the similarities in swim speeds between flatback and green \nturtles, it is possible that green turtles will have the ability to swim against similar strength currents \nas reported for flatback turtles (0.3 m/s-1).  However, the slower swimming speeds recorded for \nhawksbill turtles suggest that current speeds at which hawksbill hatchlings could swim against would \nbe weaker than 0.3 m/s-1, though to what extent is currently unknown.   \nWhen tidal influences were considered, modelled currents around the Dampier Archipelago and \nMontebello Islands ranged from <0.1 to 0.5 m/s.-1, with the greatest proportion of records within the \n0.1 – 0.2 m/s-1 range (RPS, 2019). These modelling results suggest that flatback and green turtle \nhatchlings may be able to swim against currents, for at least a proportion of the activity, should they \nbe attracted to artificial light. Hawksbill turtles may be able to swim against currents at the lowest end \nof the predicted range, which is less likely to comprise a significant proportion of the activity duration. \nIn the event that hatchlings are able to swim against current speeds, there is a risk that they could \nbecome entrapped in areas of light spill. Wilson et al., (2018) observed flatback hatchlings becoming \nentrapped in the light spill from a small survey vessel for up to one hour.  Other reports of the duration \nof time in which hatchlings may be entrapped in direct light spill varies widely; while Thums et al. \n(2016) found that light trapping was very temporary (minutes), anecdotal observations of hatchlings \nentrapped by light spill from a pipelay vessel off Barrow Island found hatchlings remained within the \nlight spill in the lee of the barge all night until dawn (K. Pendoley, pers. obs. 2003). It is possible that \nlarger vessels, such as the pipelay vessel, provide shelter on the leeward side from tidal currents \nallowing hatchlings to remain trapped in the light spill longer (K. Pendoley, pers. obs. 2003).   \nHatchlings emerging from nesting beaches of the Montebello Islands are expected to be carried E or \nW by the predominant current direction, and not in the direction of the Trunkline Project Area. Since \nthe light sources are located more than 20 km from the nesting beaches, the risk of dispersing \nhatchlings becoming attracted to light sources in the Project Area is not considered credible. \n--- Page 1033 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n18 | P a g e  \nThe majority of hatchlings emerging from nesting beaches of Rosemary Island are hawksbill turtles, \nwhich, given their swimming speeds, are considered less likely to swim against the predominant \ncurrents for a significant proportion of the activity duration. Further, the predominant current \ndirection (E or W) are unlikely to carry hatchlings (of any species) from Rosemary Island towards an \nartificial light source in the Trunkline Project Area. At Legendre Island, the predominant current \ndirection (E or W) is unlikely to carry hatchlings in the direction of the Borrow Grounds Project Area. \nShould light emissions be at a level that results in attraction, green and flatback hatchlings may be \nable to swim against currents towards the TSHD light sources.  However, given that the TSHD will only \nbe present for two hours at a time within the Borrow Grounds Project Area, any attraction will be \ntemporary, and once the TSHD has left the Project Area, dispersing behaviour under can continue \nunder natural conditions.  Since the Trunkline Project Area is W of Legendre Island, it is possible that \nhatchlings could be carried towards vessels within this area. However, while not tested empirically \ndue to the logistical constraints of tracking large numbers of hatchlings concurrently, the density of \nhatchlings will decrease with distance from the nesting beach as individuals disperse in open ocean \n(see ambient treatment results in Thums et al.,2016, Wilson et al., 2016, Wilson et al.,2019). Since the \ndistance between Legendre Island and the Trunkline Project Area is 14 km, the number of hatchlings \nemerging from Legendre Island occurring within the Trunkline Project Area is likely be a small \nproportion of the total number emerging from the closest nesting beaches.  \nIn the unlikely event that dispersing hatchlings from Rosemary Island or Legendre Island are carried \nby currents into the vicinity of the TSHD or pipelay vessel and become attracted to sources of artificial \nlight, the impact will be temporary in that attraction will only occur during hours of darkness; following \nsunrise, the attraction will cease hatchling dispersal will return.  Although attraction to light sources \nmay have consequences at the individual level (e.g. energy depletion and increased predation risk), \nthe numbers that could be impacted is unlikely to comprise a significant proportion of the annual \nnumber of hatchlings emerging from the nesting beaches.  \n--- Page 1034 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n19 | P a g e  \n4 \nSUMMARY \nThis impact assessment was conservatively based on the assumption that light emissions (in the form \nof either direct light or sky glow) from project vessels within the Trunkline and Borrow Ground Project \nAreas may be received at intensities that could result in behavioural disturbance at nesting beaches \nwith 20 km of the light sources.   \nWhile conservative, the impact assessment concluded that the light emissions from vessel activities in \nthe Trunkline and Borrow Grounds Project Areas would not have a significant impact on marine turtle \nspecies across the whole life cycle, when assessed against the EPBC Act Matters of National \nEnvironmental Significance Significant Impact Guidelines 1.1 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2013), as \ndescribed in Table 4-1.  Although behavioural impacts to marine turtles may occur, it is not expected \nthat these impacts will be contrary to the priority actions or the measure of success criteria outlined \nin the Recovery Plan (Commonwealth of Australia, 2017) for the relevant marine turtle genetic stocks, \nor management of artificial light (Table 4-1). \n \n--- Page 1035 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n20 | P a g e  \nConsideration\nConclusion \nRecovery Plan\nMarine turtles are not displaced from identified \nhabitat critical to the survival \nVessel light sources are not expected to discourage females from nesting, or effect nest site selection, \nand hence will not displace females from nesting habitat.  \nThere is no evidence to suggest that internesting females are impacted by artificial light and, therefore, \ninternesting females will not be displaced from internesting habitat. \nThat biologically important behaviour can \ncontinue in biologically important areas \nVessel light sources are not expected to discourage females from nesting, or affect nest site selection, \nmeaning that impacts to nesting behaviour is not expected to occur. While there is a small potential for \nimpact on post-nesting sea-finding behaviour of nesting females to occur, nesting females are not \nconsidered highly vulnerable to disorientation due to artificial light. Further, since vessels are either \ncontinually moving or intermittently present within the Project Areas, the number of adult females \npotentially impacted is further reduced.  \nThere is no evidence, published or anecdotal, to suggest that internesting turtles are impacted by light \nfrom offshore vessels and, therefore, changes to internesting behaviour are not expected to occur. \nWhile disruption to the behaviour of an insignificant proportion of the total annual number of emerging \nhatchlings may occur, the pipelay and TSHD vessels are continually moving within the Trunkline Project \nArea (at least 12 km away) meaning that specific beaches are not exposed to unfavourable orientation \nof light sources that could result in disruption of sea-finding behaviour for the duration of activities in \nthis area. Once the vessels have moved out of an unfavourable orientation from individual beaches \n(which is likely to occur within days to weeks), hatchling sea-finding behaviour can continue.  The Borrow \nGrounds Project Area is located 6.6 km from Legendre Island, the closest point to shore. However, \nactivities within the borrow grounds are intermittent (approximately two-hour presence in the area and \n--- Page 1036 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n21 | P a g e  \nConsideration\nConclusion \nabsent for at least five hours) further reducing the timeframe in which behavioural impacts to emerging \nhatchlings could occur.  \nWhile disruption to hatchling dispersal behaviour (e.g. attraction to or trapping by light at a vessel) of an \ninsignificant proportion of the annual number of hatchlings emerging from a given beach is credible, \nfollowing sunrise, any effect of the light sources on hatchlings will be eliminated allowing dispersal \nbehaviour to resume. Further, the potential for hatchling dispersal behaviour to be affected decreases \nwith distance to shore. The closest point between the Project Areas and turtle nesting beaches, where \nthe potential of impacts to hatchling dispersal are more likely, is 6.6 km between the Borrow Ground \nProject Area and Legendre Island. However, TSHD activities within the borrow grounds are intermittent, \nas described above, further reducing the timeframe in which behavioural impacts could occur in the \nborrow grounds. \nWhile the above behavioural impacts are credible, under a conservative assessment, it is not expected \nthese impacts will impede recovery of the relevant green (G-NWS), flatback (F-Pil) or hawksbill (H-WA) \ngenetic stocks, or result in a decreasing trend in numbers/abundance and, therefore, the project will not \nimpact the measure of success criteria of the Recovery Plan (Commonwealth of Australia, 2017). \nDevelop and implement best practice light \nmanagement guidelines for existing and future \ndevelopments adjacent to turtle nesting beaches\nAdditional controls outlined in Section 5 will ensure that the activity is conducted in a manner consistent \nwith the National Light Pollution Guidelines for Wildlife (Commonwealth of Australia, 2020). \nIdentify the cumulative impact on turtles from \nmultiple sources of onshore and offshore light \npollution \nThe TSHD and pipelay vessels will not operate concurrently since activities are required to be undertaken\nsequentially. Although these vessels may be in the Project Areas for up to eight weeks, depending on the \nactivity being undertaken, the continual movement of the vessels will prevent any one specific receptor \n(e.g. a particular nesting beach or an individual turtle) being exposed for the duration of each activity. \nDredging activities in the borrow grounds Project Area, and backfill activities in the Trunkline Project \nArea, will also be undertaken intermittently, with periods of time in which the vessel will be absent. \n--- Page 1037 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n22 | P a g e  \nConsideration\nConclusion \nAdditional support vessels may be present during some activities (e.g. pipelay activities), however, given \nthe size of the support vessels in comparison to the pipelay vessel, light emissions from the support \nvessels are unlikely to contribute significantly to overall light emissions. \nWhen considered in the context of existing industrial light sources in the region, light emissions from the \nactivities are unlikely to significantly increase light pollution of the Dampier Archipelago. Specifically, at \nRosemary Island, visibility of light emissions from the TSHD and pipelay vessels may be limited by existing \nlight emissions from vessels at the designated anchorages. \nSignificant impact criteria\nLead to a long-term decrease in the size of a \npopulation or important population \nBehavioural impacts are limited to an insignificant proportion of the overall annual number of hatchlings \nemerging from nesting beaches when considered at the ‘important nesting area’* level.  \nReduce the area of occupancy of important \npopulation \nThe activity will not permanently displace marine turtles from habitats occupied during different life \nstages. \nFragment an existing important population into \ntwo or more populations \nGiven the temporary nature of the activity (as described in Section 3.1), fragmentation of important \npopulation is not credible.  \nAdversely affect habitat critical to the survival of \na species \nThe activity is not expected to adversely affect nesting or internesting habitat due to the temporary \nnature of the activity (as described in Section 3.1), and that impacts at the individual level are unlikely. \nDisrupt the breeding cycle of an important \npopulation \nBehavioural impacts are limited to an insignificant proportion of the overall annual number of hatchlings \nemerging from nesting beaches when considered at the ‘important nesting area’ scale (‘important \nnesting areas’ as defined in the Recovery Plan). Disruption to mating, migration, internesting or nesting \nis not expected. \n--- Page 1038 ---\nSCARBOROUGH DESKTOP LIGHTING ASSESSMENT \n23 | P a g e  \nConsideration\nConclusion \nModify, destroy, remove, isolate or decrease the \navailability or quality of habitat to the extent \nthat the species is likely to decline \nGiven the temporary nature of the activity (as described in Section 3.1), the availability or quality of the \nhabitat will not be affected so that marine turtle species may decline. \nResult in invasive species that are harmful to an \nendangered or vulnerable species becoming \nestablished in the species’ habitat \nNot applicable to light emissions.\nIntroduce disease that may cause the species to \ndecline \nNot applicable to light emissions.\nSubstantially interfere with the recovery of the \nspecies \nBehavioural impacts are limited to an insignificant proportion of the overall annual number of hatchlings \nemerging from nesting beaches when considered at the ‘important nesting area’* level. Such impacts \nwill be temporary in nature (as described in Section 3.1) and will not interfere with the recovery at neither \nthe species nor genetic stock level. \n* Important nesting areas as defined in the Recovery Plan. \n \n--- Page 1039 ---\n \n24 | P a g e  \n5 \nRECOMMENDATIONS \nIt is recommended that Woodside consider the application of a hierarchy or controls in accordance \nwith the National Light Pollution Guidelines for Wildlife (Commonwealth of Australia, 2020) to reduce \npotential impacts to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) and acceptable levels. Controls for \nconsideration are described below.  \n5.1 \nControl measures \nThese control measures are consistent with the National Light Pollution Guidelines for Wildlife \n(Commonwealth of Australia, 2020). \n5.1.1 Avoid night work in sensitive windows \n \nTrunkline Project Area: peak hatchling emergence periods at Rosemary Island, Legendre \nIsland. \n \nActivities in borrow grounds Project Area: peak hatchling emergence periods at Legendre \nIsland. \n \nIf night work cannot be avoided, limit non-routine activities at night. For example, heavy lift \nactivities or crew transfers which may require additional or higher intensity of lighting, or \norientation of lighting towards nesting beaches. \n5.1.2 Activity-specific Lighting Management Plan \nThe Lighting Management Plan for specific activities should include details on: \nLight modelling \nModelling can estimate light emissions from the worst-case scenario and identify: \n \nSpecific nesting beaches that may receive light levels at an intensity that could result in \nbehavioural impact. \n \nThe distance from the vessel at which light radiance is considered ambient. \n \nIdentify lights which contribute most to overall light emissions. \nThe modelling could therefore inform: \n \nThe credibility of impacts at nesting beaches occurring (nesting females and emerging \nhatchlings). \n \nThe distance at which hatchlings would need to swim offshore before encountering light \nsources that could result in disturbance to dispersal behaviour. \n \nThe size of spatial buffers around important habitats within which additional or adaptive \nmanagement may be required. \nLight model accuracy can be increased by incorporating measurements of existing lighting levels within \nthe region. This model could show that light from the pipelay vessel will not add significantly to light \n--- Page 1040 ---\n \n25 | P a g e  \nintensity and sky glow at regional scale, when accounting for existing light sources (i.e. moorings and \nanchorages between Rosemary Island and the Trunkline Project Area).  \nLight type and positioning \nIf light modelling indicates impacts at beaches is credible, the following controls should be considered: \n \nAdjusting orientation of lights to minimise horizontal light spill (all lights) \n \nApply additional shielding to a) all lights, or, if not practicable, b) the highest intensity lights, \nwhere practicable \n \nChange a) all lights, or, if not practicable, b) the highest intensity lights, to amber wavelength \nwere safety standards allow. \nWhere orientation and additional shielding can be applied, the model can be rerun to indicate efficacy \nof these control measures. \nHousekeeping \nIn all cases, additional housekeeping controls would reduce overall light emissions, including: \n \nClosing blinds during hours of darkness \n \nSwitching off non-operational lights when not required \n \nConsider motion activated lights were safety standards allow \nVessel inspection \nPrior to the vessel entering within 20 km of nesting beaches, or a spatial buffer informed by modelling, \na vessel inspection would occur to: \n \nEnsure orientation of lights is such that only the intended object is illuminated \n \nIdentify areas of direct light spill on the water and apply additional shielding \n \nEnsure compliance with housekeeping control measures \n5.1.3 Adaptive management \nIf the activity is undertaken during peak hatchling season, and modelling predicts impacts are credible, \nadaptive management could be applied, such as: \n \nDedicated observers will monitor the area of light spill for entrapped hatchlings. If a number \nof hatchlings, to be determined, are observed in an area of light spill, the lights will be switched \noff for half an hour (to allow dispersal behaviour to continue).  \n \nIf impacts at the nesting beach are credible, and activity is undertaken in hatchling season, \nhatchling orientation data will be collected when the vessel is operating within distances at \nwhich impacts may occur. If either the spread or offset angle is considered to deviate \n--- Page 1041 ---\n \n26 | P a g e  \nsignificantly (to be determined) from a known baseline, restrictions in night operations will be \nconsidered. \n--- Page 1042 ---\n \n27 | P a g e  \n6 \nREFERENCES \nADVISIAN (2019) Dampier Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey.

These facilities are \nproposed to be connected to the mainland through an approximately 430 km trunkline to an \nonshore facility.  \nInstallation of the trunkline will involve pre-lay dredging and pipelay, followed by post-lay backfill \nwithin a Trunkline Project Area. Backfill material will be dredged from a separate area, the Borrow \nGrounds Project Area. Specialised vessels will be utilized for specific activities. As described in the \nNational Light Pollution Guidelines for Wildlife Including Marine Turtles, Seabirds and Migratory \nShorebirds (Commonwealth of Australia, 2020), light emissions from project vessels have the \npotential to impact marine turtles at nesting beaches and in open ocean. \nA conservative desktop assessment of potential impacts of ALAN on marine turtles was undertaken in \nabsence of light modelling by assuming that potential impacts were credible within 20 km of the light \nsources (Pendoley Environmental, 2020). While this impact assessment is considered conservative, \ndue to the uncertainties associated with predicting light emissions of the vessels without relevant \ninformation, Advisian engaged Pendoley Environmental on behalf of Woodside to undertake light \nmodelling to aid assessment of light emissions from the proposed pipelay vessel and trailing suction \nhopper dredger (TSHD) vessel.  \n \n \n--- Page 1053 ---\nSCARBOROUGH LIGHT MODELLING \n2 | P a g e  \n2 \nMETHODOLOGY \nLight modelling was undertaken for the proposed pipelay and TSHD vessels to predict the extent \nof biologically relevant light spill. Specifics of the respective vessel’s lighting design and luminaire \nspecifications were applied to the ILLUMINA Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) model (Aube et al. \n2005). The ILLUMINA model is a three-dimensional model that accounts for both line of sight and \natmospheric scattering, allowing the attenuation of light over distance and extent of light glow \nto be modelled.  The reader is directed to Aube et al. (2005) for details of equations and model \nparameterisation. \nUnlike a simple line of sight model based on the inverse square law formula, this is a more \nsophisticated model which allows individual light sources (i.e. individual luminaires) to be placed \nwithin the area of interest (as opposed to assuming a single large light point source for the entire \nvessel). The model input parameters also include project specific details about light type, spectral \ndistribution, height and orientation of individual luminaires, including any shielding, which \nsubstantially increases the model precision and accuracy.  \n2.1 \nModel Inputs \nInformation regarding the light inventory was extracted from lighting layout drawings and light \nmanufacturer data sheets provided to Pendoley Environmental by Woodside for both the \nCasterone pipelay vessel and Gateway TSHD, and included:  \n \nnumber of each type of light \n \nspectral output of light type \n \nangular distribution of light (shielding) \n \nlumen output of each type of light \n \nheight of each light \nDetails of individual lights are summarised in (Annex 1). \nBecause the atmospheric conditions over the NWS are typically clear, the model simulations \npresented here assumed no contribution of light from cloud reflectance. \nSurface reflectance and elevation values are incorporated into the model from aerial imagery \nsupplied by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Earthdata and the NOAA \n(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) (NASA, 2020; NOAA, 2020) as per the \nmethodology outlined in Aube et al. (2005).  \nModel outputs are provided in radiance (W/m2/sr, where W = watts, m2 =meters squared and sr \n= steradian). \n \n--- Page 1054 ---"

The reasoning used was:  \n \nthe range of moon brightness across a whole lunar cycle is a realistic scale representative \nof the ambient light levels that turtle eyes are adapted to, at the lower end of the scale \nthe radiant output is equivalent to no light in the sky while the upper limit is greater than \nthe radiance from a single full moon and  was selected to try to account for the increase \nin radiance levels that would occur if the light was reflected from clouds (recognizing that \ncloudy conditions are not the norm for this site). Extending the scale beyond this limit was \ndeemed unnecessary.  \n \nthe scale for the units “the proportion of radiance of one full moon” was derived from \nthe logarithmic nature of light decay with distance (a function of the inverse square law), \ne.g. the scale of <0.01, 0.01 – 0.1, 0.1 – 1, 1 – 10 represents a range of radiant brightness \nfrom a minimum of <0.01 full moon (so essentially a new moon) to a maximum radiant \nbrightness of the equivalent to 10 full moons.  \n \nWhile the behavioural response of marine turtles to light is relatively well understood \n(see Witherington and Martin (2003) for review), there is currently no agreed upon \nintensity limits for determining what the impact of a given light might be.  A large range \nof factors influence the visibility and impact of light on hatchlings including light intensity, \nvisibility (a function of lamp orientation and shielding), spectral power distribution \n(wavelength and colour), atmospheric scattering, cloud reflectance, spatial extent of sky \nglow, duration of exposure, horizon elevation, lunar phase, hatchling swimming speeds, \ntide and current speeds and flow direction etc. Using the scale of light radiance derived \nfrom the calculated decrease in light intensity with distance (proportion radiance of a full \nmoon) and together with our extensive SME experience observing marine turtles and \ntheir response to both onshore and offshore construction light in field settings, we have \nproposed conservative, potential impact criteria for marine turtles based on radiance \nthresholds relative to moon radiance, as shown in Table 2-1. \n \n \n--- Page 1056 ---\nSCARBOROUGH LIGHT MODELLING \n5 | P a g e  \nProportion of radiance \nof a full moon* \nImpact potential to marine turtles\n1 - 10\nLight or light glow visible and impact likely, represents a very bright \nlight equivalence to up to 10 times the radiance of one moon.

For example, radiance is equivalent to 0.01 of a full moon at 1,783.80 m \nwhen modelled at point 1, but 1,783.97 m when modelled at point 2 (Table 3-1). However, this \ndifference is not detectable when the distance to source is reported in km to one decimal place. \nSince all other model inputs are identical (e.g. light inventory and cloud reflectance), site-specific \ndifferences in surface reflectance, as determined from the satellite imagery model inputs at each \nlocation, is the likely cause. Reflectance of the water surface can be influenced by oceanographic \nvariables such as water turbidity, wave height and water depth.  \nWhen applying the potential impact criteria in Table 2-1 the results show that, at ~5.7 km from \nthe source, radiance has reduced to ambient. At distances between ~ 1.8 km and ~5.7 km from \nthe source, radiance is equivalent to between 0.1 and 0.01 radiance of a full moon and, therefore, \nlight may be visible but unlikely to result in a behavioural impact (i.e. biologically relevant). \nImpacts may occur within ~1.8 km of the pipelay vessel, depending on moon phase, and are more \nlikely within ~0.6 km of the vessel, when radiance is equivalent to that of one full moon.  \nAt the closest point to Rosemary Island (14 km), radiance is equal to 0.002 (0.2%) that of a full \nmoon.

As with the pipelay vessel, there is a small \ndifference in distances reported at the two different locations, with greater distances from source \nwhen modelled at point 3 compared to point 1 (Table 3-2). For example, radiance is equivalent \nto 0.01 of a full moon at 1,477.98 m when modelled at point 1, but 1,479.49 m when modelled \nat point 3 (Table 3-2). However, this difference is not detectable when the distance to source is \nreported in km to one decimal place. As described in Section 3.1 above, this difference is due to \nvariation in surface reflectance at each location which is influenced by oceanographic variables.  \nApplying the potential impact criteria in Table 2-1, the results show that at ~4.7 km from the \nsource light levels have reduced to ambient.

Pipelay vessel Casterone at the closest point of the Trunkline Project Area to Rosemary \nIsland (point 1, 14.15 km) \n2. Pipelay vessel Casterone at the closest point of the Trunkline Project Area to Legendre \nisland (point 2, 12 km) \n3. TSHD Gateway at the closest point of the Trunkline Project Area to Rosemary Island (point \n1, 14.15 km) \n4. TSHD Gateway at the closest point of the Borrow Grounds Project Area to Legendre island \n(point 3, 6.6 km) \nModel outputs are in radiance (W/m2/sr) and presented as a proportion of the radiance of a full moon \nas a realistic scale representative of the natural conditions experienced by a marine turtle in the field \nand to provide biological context.  \nThe distance from source at which a given level of radiance was reached (reported as proportion of \nradiance of a full moon) was greater for the pipelay vessel compared to the TSHD, indicating that light \nemissions from the pipelay vessel are greater than the TSHD. Modelled light emissions of the same \nvessel differed between locations due to differences in the ocean reflectance values at each location. \nHowever, this difference is not detectable when the distance to source is reported in km to one \ndecimal place.  \nLight emissions were predicted to reduce to ambient levels (0.01, or 1%, radiance of a full moon) at \n5.7 km and 4.7 km from the pipelay vessel and TSHD, respectively. There is potential for behavioural \nimpacts (more than 0.01, or 1%, radiance of a full moon) to occur within 1.8 km and 1.5 km from the \npipelay vessel and TSHD, respectively. Behavioural impacts are more likely (≥ radiance of one full \nmoon) within 0.6 km and 0.5 km of the pipelay vessel and TSHD, respectively. \nAt the closest point to Rosemary Island (14 km), radiance from the pipelay vessel is equal to 0.002 \n(0.2%), and from the TSHD 0.003 (0.3%), that of a full moon. \nAt the closest point to Legendre Island (12 km), radiance from the pipelay vessel is equal to 0.003 \n(0.3%) that of a full moon. From the TSHD (6.6 km), radiance is equal to 0.005 (0.5%) that of a full \nmoon. \n4.2 \nImpact Assessment \nA conservative assessment of potential impacts of ALAN on marine turtles was undertaken in absence \nof light modelling by assuming that potential impacts were credible within 20 km of the light sources \n(Pendoley Environmental, 2020). The impact assessment concluded that the light emissions from \nvessel activities in the Trunkline and Borrow Grounds Project Areas would not have a significant impact \n--- Page 1063 ---\nSCARBOROUGH LIGHT MODELLING \n12 | P a g e  \non marine turtle species across the whole life cycle, when assessed against the EPBC Act Matters of \nNational Environmental Significance Significant Impact Guidelines 1.1 (Commonwealth of Australia, \n2013).  Although behavioural impacts to marine turtles were assessed as credible, it was concluded \nthat these impacts would not be contrary to the priority actions or the measure of success criteria \noutlined in the Recovery Plan (Commonwealth of Australia, 2017) for the relevant marine turtle \ngenetic stocks, or management of artificial light (Pendoley Environmental, 2020). \nWhile this impact assessment is considered conservative, due to the uncertainties associated with \npredicting light emissions of the vessels without relevant information, light modelling was conducted, \nas detailed in this report.  \nResults of the light modelling suggest that, given the distance to Rosemary and Legendre Islands at \nthe closest point (14 km and 6.6 km, respectively), light emissions from neither vessels are expected \nto be visible at nesting beaches of these islands and, therefore, impacts to nesting females and \nemerging hatchlings are not considered credible.  \nDispersing hatchlings may be attracted to artificial light within 1.8 km and 1.5 km of the pipelay vessel \nand TSHD, respectively, but this potential for attraction is expected to be overridden by the radiance \nof the moon during full moon periods. Attraction of hatchlings to vessel lighting is more likely within \n0.6 km and 0.5 km of the pipelay vessel and TSHD, respectively. Even assuming the greater distances \nof 1.8 km and 1.5 km, considering the predominant currents and distances to the nearest important \nnesting beaches, the proportion of hatchlings vulnerable to attraction is expected to be notably less \nthan that assumed in the conservative impact assessment (Pendoley Environmental, 2020). \nWith consideration to the modelling results outlined in Section 3, the assessment of potential impacts \nagainst the Significance Significant Impact Guidelines 1.1 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2013), priority \nactions and measure of success criteria outlined in the Recovery Plan (Commonwealth of Australia, \n2017) was reassessed, as summarised in Table 4-1. \nIt is recommended that Woodside consider the proposed control measures described in Section 5 of \nPendoley Environmental (2020) in the context of these modelling results. \n \n--- Page 1064 ---\nSCARBOROUGH LIGHT MODELLING \n13 | P a g e  \nConsideration \nConclusion \nRecovery Plan\nMarine turtles are not displaced from \nidentified habitat critical to the survival \nVessel light sources are not expected to be visible from nesting beaches and, therefore, displacement of\nfemales from nesting habitat will not occur.  \nThere is no evidence to suggest that internesting females are impacted by artificial light and, therefore, \ninternesting females will not be displaced from internesting habitat (see Pendoley Environmental (2020) \nfor further discussion). \nThat biologically important behaviour can \ncontinue in biologically important areas \nVessel light sources are not expected to be visible from nesting beaches and, therefore, disruption to \nfemale nesting behaviour, or hatchling emergence behaviour, is not expected to occur.  \nThere is no evidence, published or anecdotal, to suggest that internesting turtles are impacted by light \nfrom offshore vessels and, therefore, changes to internesting behaviour are not expected to occur (see \nPendoley Environmental (2020) for further discussion). \nWhile disruption to hatchling dispersal behaviour (e.g. attraction to or trapping by light at a vessel) is \ncredible, the number of hatchlings potentially impacted is expected to be an insignificant proportion of \nthe annual number of hatchlings emerging from a given beach since the predominant currents are \nunlikely to transport hatchlings towards the Project Areas and that the distance from important nesting \nbeaches to the point at which light emissions could elicit a behavioural response are: \n \n5.1 km from Legendre Island (when determined as the closest point to the Borrow Grounds Project \nArea (6.6 km) subtracted by the distance from the source at which impacts could occur – i.e. 1.5. \nkm for the TSHD); or  \n--- Page 1065 ---\nSCARBOROUGH LIGHT MODELLING \n14 | P a g e  \nConsideration \nConclusion \n \n12.2 km from Rosemary Island (when determined as the closest point to the Trunkline Project Area \n(14 km) subtracted by the distance from the source at which impacts could occur – i.e. 1.8. km for \nthe pipelay vessel). \nIn the unlikely event that hatchlings are attracted to vessel lighting, and become entrapped in light spill, \nfollowing sunrise, any effect of the light sources on hatchlings will be eliminated allowing dispersal \nbehaviour to resume.  \nWhile behavioural impacts to dispersing turtle hatchlings are credible, it is not expected these impacts \nwill impede recovery of the relevant green (G-NWS), flatback (F-Pil) or hawksbill (H-WA) genetic stocks, \nor result in a decreasing trend in numbers/abundance and, therefore, the project will not impact the \nmeasure of success criteria of the Recovery Plan (Commonwealth of Australia, 2017). \nDevelop and implement best practice light \nmanagement guidelines for existing and future \ndevelopments adjacent to turtle nesting beaches\nAdditional controls are outlined in Section 5 of Pendoley Environmental (2020) will ensure that the \nactivity is conducted in a manner consistent with the National Light Pollution Guidelines for Wildlife \n(Commonwealth of Australia, 2020). \nIdentify the cumulative impact on turtles from \nmultiple sources of onshore and offshore light \npollution \nThe TSHD and pipelay vessels will not operate concurrently since activities are required to be undertaken \nsequentially. Although these vessels may be in the Project Areas for up to eight weeks, depending on the \nactivity being undertaken, the continual movement of the vessels will prevent any one specific receptor \n(e.g. an individual turtle at sea) being exposed for the duration of each activity. Dredging activities in the \nBorrow Grounds Project Area, and backfill activities in the Trunkline Project Area, will also be undertaken \nintermittently, with periods of time in which the vessel will be absent (see Pendoley Environmental \n(2020) for further details on the activity). \nAdditional support vessels may be present during some activities (e.g. pipelay activities), however, given \nthe size of the support vessels in comparison to the pipelay vessel, light emissions from the support \nvessels are unlikely to contribute significantly to overall light emissions. \n--- Page 1066 ---\nSCARBOROUGH LIGHT MODELLING \n15 | P a g e  \nConsideration \nConclusion \nWhen considered in the context of existing industrial light sources in the region, light emissions from the \nactivities are unlikely to significantly increase light pollution of the Dampier Archipelago. Specifically, at \nRosemary Island, visibility of light emissions from the TSHD and pipelay vessels may be limited by existing \nlight emissions from vessels at the designated anchorages (see Pendoley Environmental (2020) for \nfurther details on existing light sources). \nSignificant impact criteria\nLead to a long-term decrease in the size of a \npopulation or important population \nBehavioural impacts are limited to an insignificant proportion of the overall annual number of hatchlings \ndispersing from nesting beaches and is not considered likely to result in a long-term decrease in the size \nof a population or important population. \nReduce the area of occupancy of important \npopulation \nThe activity will not permanently displace marine turtles from habitats occupied during different life \nstages. \nFragment an existing important population \ninto two or more populations \nGiven the temporary nature of the activity (in comparison to a permanent facility, for example), \nfragmentation of important population is not credible.  \nAdversely affect habitat critical to the survival \nof a species \nThe activity is not expected to adversely affect nesting or internesting habitat due to the limited spatial \nextent of potential impact, temporary nature of the activity, and that impacts at the individual level are \nunlikely. \nDisrupt the breeding cycle of an important \npopulation \nBehavioural impacts are limited to an insignificant proportion of the overall annual number of hatchlings \ndispersing from nesting beaches.

I should add \nthat we are broadly supportive of the proposed Burrup Hub \nproject and do not seek to unnecessarily delay the process.  \nIf our request for an extension until the 13th of September \n2019 can be granted, it would be most appreciated by \nMAC’s members who are the cultural custodians of the land \nand waters which could potentially be impacted by this \nproposal.” \nOn the afternoon that the OPP public comment period closed on 30 \nAugust 2019, the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation (MAC) lodged a \nrequest for a two-week extension to comment on the OPP. In response \nto this request, Woodside's Indigenous Affairs Manager met with \nMAC's CEO on 2 September 2019. Woodside explained the proposed \nScarborough development area and asked whether there was a \nspecific issue MAC had wished to raise. While MAC advised of its \nintention to make comment on the Dredging and Spoil Disposal \nManagement Plan required by the Western Australian Environmental \nProtection Authority as part of its assessment of the proposed \ndevelopment, MAC responded that it did not have any particular \nconcerns about the OPP. MAC further advised, the intention for \nrequesting an extension was to reserve its right to comment, if \nnecessary. Consequently, MAC was advised it would be unlikely \nWoodside would support an extension and MAC confirmed it would \naccept a decision not to extend the comment period. No further action \nwas recorded. \nWoodside notes MAC’s purpose is to administer the Burrup and \nMaitland Industrial Estate Agreement (BMIEA) on behalf of Traditional \nOwner “contracting parties”.  We further note that the organisation is \nthe representative for joint management of the Murujuga National Park. \nMAC receives annual funding from Woodside under the BMIEA \nAgreement to carry out its specific cultural obligations and \nresponsibilities including input on regulatory approvals.  Annual \npayments in direct benefits are made under the BMIEA (annual lease \npayment) in addition to Conservation Agreement funds for MAC \nRangers other direct financial support provided for related programs \nand activities. \nWoodside will continue to work with MAC and Traditional Owner \nrepresentatives as the proposed Scarborough development is \nprogressed. \nRecord of this engagement has \nbeen added to Table 10.5 \n(‘Phase 2 stakeholder \nconsultation activities’).  \n2 \n \nEnvironmental \nDefenders Office \n(on behalf of \nCCWA) \n \nComments have been compiled by the EDO on behalf of \nCCWA.  The key issues are summarised below according to \nthe EDO submission section. \nSubsections of the submission are addressed below. \nSubsections of the submission \nare addressed below. \n2.1 \n \nEnvironmental \nDefenders Office \n(on behalf of \nCCWA) \n \nBackground  \nContains statements about the proposal from the OPP. \nThe statements about the project reflect information in the OPP and do \nnot require a response. \nThe statements about the \nproject reflect information in the \nOPP and do not require \namendment of the document. \n2.2 \n \nEnvironmental \nDefenders Office \n(on behalf of \nCCWA) \n \nImpact of GHG Emissions (summary section) \n(EDO submission sections 6-14) * \nIt is submitted that: \n• \nthe OPP fails to manage the impacts/risks of the \nProposal’s GHGe to a level that is acceptable in \naccordance with the established science of climate \nchange, the EPBC Act or Australia’s international \nobligations under the Paris Agreement   \n• \nthe OPP and the above controls are insufficient to \nmanage the impacts and risks of the \nProposal’s GHGe to an acceptable level or as low \nas reasonably practicable (ALARP)   \n• \nchanges to the OPP are required to sufficiently \nmanage impacts and risks of Greenhouse Gas \nemissions (GHGe); and   \nThe themes raised in this summary section of the submission are \ncovered in more detail in subsections of the submission.

The Australian \nGovernment has ratified the Paris Agreement and implemented policy \nmechanisms as described in Section 3.4.1 (which has been added to \nprovide further detail). \nCompliance with Australian legislation, as described in Sections 3.4.1 \nand 6.5 ensures that GHGe from the Project will be acceptable by \nkeeping GHGe at or below the emissions baselines set by the Clean \nEnergy Regulator or dealing with any excess emissions accordingly. \nAs described in the OPP, raw product from the Scarborough Project \nwill be processed at the onshore Pluto LNG facility. Existing \nenvironmental approvals for the Pluto LNG facility already include \nprocessing emissions for a second train and scope 3 emissions \nassociated with sold product. Figure 7.6 has been added to section \n7.1.3 of the OPP to better illustrate how related onshore processing \nemissions are considered in the existing approved Pluto PER. \nPluto is required to have in place management plans including a \nGreenhouse Gas Abatement Program developed to address the \nrequirements of Ministerial Statement 757, which ensures ongoing \nregulatory oversight. The Pluto approvals process is out of scope for \nthe OPP.    \nSection 3.4.1 (‘Greenhouse Gas \nLegislation’) has been added, \nwhich describes Australian \nGHG legislation. \nA statement in the second \nparagraph of section 6.2.3 \n(‘Risk Assessment – \nEnvironmental Legisation and \nother requirements’) has been \nadded about Australia’s \nratification of the Paris \nAgreement as a relevant \ninternational standard.  \nParagraph six has been added \nto Section 6.5  (‘Environmental \nPerfomance Outcomes and \nAcceptable Levels’) to link \nAustralia’s implementation of \nthe Paris Agreement via \nlegislation to the acceptability of \nthe project. \nThe part of section 7.1.3 \n(Planned Aspects – Routine \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions) \ndescribing related onshore \nprocessing emissions has been \nexpanded, including \nincorporation of updated \nassumptions relating to scope 3 \nemissions.  \nDiscussion of risks and impacts \nassociated with climate change, \nincluding change in habitats, \nfauna behaviour, injury/mortality \nto fauna, and social changes \nhas been added in section \n7.1.3.8 \n 2.4 \n \nEnvironmental \nDefenders Office \n(on behalf of \nCCWA) \n \nTotal Lifecycle GHGe Should be Considered and \nManaged \n(EDO submission sections 24-30) * \nIt is submitted that: \n• \nthe Pluto PER process did not assess and approve \nScope 3 emissions and proposes amendment of \nthe OPP to include details and management of total \nlifecycle GHG, including risk and impact to the \nenvironment and rock art using the best available \nclimate science.  \nAs described in the OPP, raw product from the Scarborough project will \nbe processed at the onshore Pluto LNG facility. Existing environmental \napprovals for the Pluto LNG facility already include processing \nemissions for a second train and scope 3 emissions associated with \nsold product. Figure 7.6 has been added to section 7.1.3 of the OPP to \nbetter illustrate how related onshore processing emissions are \nconsidered in the existing approved Pluto PER. \nThe part of section 7.1.3 \n(Routine Greenhouse Gas \nEmissions) describing indirect \nGHG emissions has been \nupdated to include a reference \nto where in the Pluto PER \nlifecycle emissions are included \nand recalculation of scope 3 \nemissions attributed to \nScarborough with updated \nassumptions. \nThe new sections 7.1.3.3 \n(Lifecycle and Intensity) and \n7.1.3.4 (Natural Gas in the \nContext of Global Emissions) \nhave been added to more \ncomprehensively explain how \n--- Page 1076 ---\nScarborough – Offshore Project Proposal \n \nThis document is protected by copyright.

The Burrup Hub is not a \nproposal for a single activity for impact assessment; it describes \nWoodside’s vision of several separate but related activities that, subject \nto respective joint venture approvals and relevant regulatory approvals, \nmay be undertaken. The current allocation of approvals between \njurisdictions has been established with all relevant regulatory bodies.  \nAs described in the OPP, the contribution of the Scarborough floating \npetroleum unit (FPU) to Australian and global GHGE is very low. \nAttempting to model the impact on global climate change is not \nfeasible, and similarly it is not practical to describe associated risk to \nglobal receptors.     \nWoodside has determined that \nthe approvals approach in place \nfor the individual Burrup Hub \nactivities are adequate and no \nchanges were made to the \ndocument. \n 2.6 \n \nEnvironmental \nDefenders Office \n(on behalf of \nCCWA) \n \nNet Zero Emissions Outcome Should be Applied as \nEnvironmental Performance Outcome \n(EDO submission sections 45-54) * \nIt is submitted that: \n \n• \nthe environmental performance outcomes \ndescribed in the OPP are insufficient to achieve \nacceptability for GHG emissions, and that a “net \nzero” performance outcome should be adopted, \nstating that this should be the fundamental test for \nenvironmental acceptability.   \n• \nby reference to the DOE Report for the Prelude \nFLNG Facility (2010), the project should result in no \nnet increase in Australia’s GHG emissions, and \n• \nthe IPCC Special Report on Global Warming \nstatement has established that global GHG must \nachieve net zero by 2050 to avoid global warming \nabove 1.5°C is relevant.   \n• \na carbon budget approach is appropriate and \nproposes that internationally agreed science has \nestablished that the amount of emissions allowable \nto maintain a safe climate has already been \nexceeded and therefore all future developments \nshould achieve net zero GHG emissions.   \n• \nthe project requires implementation of technologies \nsuch as renewables, all-electric design or carbon \ncapture and storage, or offsets.  \nAchieving “net zero” GHGe abatement goes beyond the Climate \nChange Authority’s recommendation to achieve that outcome by 2050. \nThe Australian Government has established a 26-28% emissions \nreduction target by 2030 and the Paris Agreement encourages \nAustralia to submit a new target by 2025. The State of Western \nAustralian Government has also set an aspiration to achieve net zero \nemissions by 2050. Woodside’s climate policy encourages government \nto set targets based on climate science. \nAcceptability for Scarborough project GHGe is achieved by actions \ntaken to achieve compliance with Australian legislation which \nimplements the Paris Agreement by keeping GHGe at or below the \nemissions baselines set by the Clean Energy Regulator or dealing with \nany excess emissions accordingly. Further details are provided within \nthe response to 15-23 (Item 2.3). \nSection 3.4.1 (‘Greenhouse Gas \nLegislation’) has been added, \nwhich describes Australian \nGHG legislation. \nA statement in the second \nparagraph of Section 6.2.3 \n(‘Risk Assessment – \nEnvironmental Legisation and \nother requirements’)  has been \nadded about Australia’s \nratification of the Paris \nAgreement as a relevant \ninternational standard. A new \nsection 7.1.3.5 (Customer \nCommitments under the Paris \nAgreement) has been included \nto provide examples of how \nScope 3 emissions from \nScarborough will fit within the \ninternational agreement, \nParagraph six has been added \nto section 6.5 (‘Environmental \nPerfomance Outcomes and \nAcceptable Levels’)  to link \nAustralia’s implementation of \nthe Paris Agreement via \nlegislation to the acceptability of \nthe project. \nThe new sections 7.1.3.3 \n(Lifecycle and Intensity) and \n7.1.3.4 (Natural Gas in the \nContext of Global Emissions) \nhave been added to more \n--- Page 1077 ---\nScarborough – Offshore Project Proposal \n \nThis document is protected by copyright.

A new section 7.1.3.6 \n(Greenhouse Gas Management \nand Mitigation) has been added \nto describe relevant controls in \na hierarchy, including these \ndesign features but also how \nGHG emissions will be \nmanaged during operations.   \n 2.8 \n \nEnvironmental \nDefenders Office \n(on behalf of \nCCWA) \n \nSpecific Control Measures Required to Manage Impacts \nof GHGe to Acceptable Level  \n(EDO submission sections 59-64) * \nIt is submitted that: \n• \nthe OPP does not refer to any specific control \nmeasures to manage impacts or avoid, reduce or \noffset. DOE report on Prelude is cited in reference \nto required measures and offsets that result in no \nnet increase to Australia’s CO2 emissions.   \n• \nthe OPP should consider LNG projects (Kitimat, \nGorgon) that are employing renewable energy and \ncarbon capture storage for management of GHG to \nan acceptable level.  \nThe environmental performance outcomes in the OPP are designed to \nensure that the risks and impacts associated with the project are \nacceptable. Compliance with the safeguarding mechanism will ensure \nthat emission reductions implemented through the Emissions \nReduction Fund (ERF) are not offset or exceeded by significant GHG \nemissions (above ‘business-as-usual levels’) emanating from other \nindustrial or economic sectors. The safeguarding mechanism includes \na framework to offset emissions if necessary for compliance. \n \nSection 3.4.1 (‘Greenhouse Gas \nLegislation’) has been added, \nwhich describes Australian \nGHG legislation. \nA statement in the second \nparagraph of section 6.2.3 \n(‘Risk Assessment – \nEnvironmental Legisation and \nother requirements’) has been \nadded about Australia’s \nratification of the Paris \nAgreement as a relevant \ninternational standard.  \n 2.9 \n \nEnvironmental \nDefenders Office \n(on behalf of \nCCWA) \n \nReporting Under NGER Act Insufficient to Manage \nImpacts of GHGe to Acceptable Level \n(EDO submission sections 65-69) * \nSubmits that voluntary public reporting should be \nimplemented that includes facility level GHG data, including \nScope 3, performance on managing GHG to acceptable and \nALARP, publish through a government hosted portal and \ninclude data on offsets.  \nThe NGER Act requires the Clean Energy Regulator to publish facility \nlevel emissions on an annual basis for facilities subject to the \nSafeguard Mechanism, including the use of Australian Carbon Credit \nUnits. \nAdditionally, Woodside also currently voluntarily participates in the \nCarbon Disclosure Project which includes publishing scope 3 \nemissions data at an equity, portfolio level. \nWoodside considers that GHG \nemissions reporting is \nadequately described in the \ndocument and no changes were \nmade. \nThe new sections 7.1.3.3 \n(Lifecycle and Intensity) and \n7.1.3.4 (Natural Gas in the \nContext of Global Emissions) \nhave been added to more \ncomprehensively explain how \nScarborough fits into a \ndecarbonising global economy. \nA new section in the \nAssessment of Alternatives \nsection (4.5.4.1 – Energy \nEfficiencies) has been added to \ndescribe measures \nimplemented to date in design \nphase.

However, it does \nhave the potential to play a role in displacing higher carbon intensity \nfossil fuels and complementing renewables. In 2019, the International \nEnergy Agency concluded that gas use has resulted in over 500 \nMtCO2e emissions savings since 2010, where it had displaced coal \npower. Providing clean burning LNG as a power source can displace \nhigher emissions energy sources in transport and power generation \nand provide firming capacity for renewable energy sources in a growing \nglobal economy.  \n \nThe new sections 7.1.3.3 \n(Lifecycle and Intensity) and \n7.1.3.4 (Natural Gas in the \nContext of Global Emissions) \nhave been added to more \ncomprehensively explain how \nScarborough fits into a \ndecarbonising global economy. \n 2.11 \n \nEnvironmental \nDefenders Office \n(on behalf of \nCCWA) \n \nImpact on Rock Art \n(EDO submission sections 80-86) * \nIt is submitted that: \n• \nthe OPP does not contain details of risk and impact \nof the project and related Burrup Hub on Murujuga \nrock art, or any control measures. \n• \nincludes reference to NOx and CO2 from the \nproposal over estimated 2070 life of field and refers \nto controls for French cave paintings which include \nmitigation of CO2 from tourists’ breath.  \nThe effective management of Aboriginal cultural heritage is critical to \nWoodside’s continued operations and growth success.   \nWoodside’s preferred development concept is to transport gas from the \nScarborough fields through a pipeline for processing at the Woodside \noperated onshore Pluto LNG Facility.  Emissions from the Pluto LNG \nFacility will remain within the impact envelope of the existing approval \nfor that facility.  Woodside has contributed to air monitoring studies of \nthe Burrup Peninsula since 2008 and our approach to emissions \nmanagement practices has been informed by third-party studies \nincluding the work undertaken by the Burrup Rock Art Monitoring \nManagement Committee.  Woodside’s approach to protection of rock \nart on the Burrup Peninsula is further informed by our relationship with \nthe Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation and Traditional Owners and takes \ninto account their vision for the protection and management of cultural \nheritage.  Woodside is also playing an active and productive role in the \nDepartment of Water and Environmental Regulation’s Burrup Rock Art \nStakeholder Reference Group, established in 2018. \nWoodside will continue to focus on emissions reductions from all its \noperations and support appropriate scientific air emissions monitoring.   \nWoodside considers potential \nmeasures described in this \ncomment to be outside the \nscope of the OPP.  As indicated \nin the response to this \ncomment, Woodside will \ncontinue to work with \nstakeholders on this issue \nthrough the appropriate \nmechanisms.    \n 2.12 \n \nEnvironmental \nDefenders Office \n(on behalf of \nCCWA) \n \nControl Measures to Manage Impacts on Rock Art \nRequired \n(EDO submission sections 87-91) * \nIt is submitted that: \n• \nthe OPP must include control measures for \nmanaging the impacts/risks on rock art and \nproposes a precautionary approach in context of \nUNESCO World Heritage nomination for the Burrup \nPeninsula.  \nWoodside supports the decision of Traditional Owners and the State to \npursue World Heritage listing for the Burrup Peninsula.  This support \nreflects our commitment to the successful co-existence of heritage and \nindustry.  In this context, Woodside also supports the reinstatement of \nambient air quality monitoring on the Burrup Peninsula and is working \nwith stakeholders including Traditional Owners and the State on the \npreferred monitoring options and approach. \nWoodside considers potential \nmeasures described in this \ncomment to be outside the \nscope of the OPP.  As indicated \nin response to a related \ncomment above, Woodside will \ncontinue to work with \nstakeholders on this issue \nthrough the appropriate \nmechanisms.    \n3 \n \nWestern Gas \n \nIt is suggested that in relation to Woodside’s statement in \nthe OPP that it is engaging other resource owners on future \ndevelopment opportunities (section 4.1) these opportunities \nshould be included as alternate development options in the \nOPP. \nThe OPP currently identifies the Equus development as a future \nproposal in section 5.7.6.  This section has been further updated to \nshow the location of the Equus fields in Figure 5-57 and notes the \nproposed project in Table 5-11.  \nAs per Table 10.5 Woodside has held a series of consultations with \nWestern Gas with regards to alternate development concepts. The \nmerits of these concepts were subject to internal assessment \nprocesses and were considered unsuitable for the current development \ntimeline.

The policy states that for assessments under the EPBC \nAct, offsets are only required if residual impacts are significant, with \nsignificance to be as defined in the Matters of National Environmental \nSignificance (MNES) – Significant impact guidelines 1.1. \nThe residual impacts of Scarborough to all MNES has been assessed \nto not be significant under the significant impact guidelines.   \nIn terms of cumulative impacts, in section 8.2.2 (‘Receptor-based \nCulmulative Impacts’), the cumulative impacts from Pluto, Equus, \nFisheries and Shipping were assessed, and it was identified that the \naspects that were common to those activities related to vessel \nmovements (i.e. physical presence – displacement, light emissions and \nvessel discharges).  Cumulative assessment has been undertaken \nwhich indicates that residual impacts to species (including MNES) are \nlow. \nA seventh paragraph was \nadded to section 6.2.3 (‘Risk \nAssessment – Environmental \nLegisation and other \nrequirements’) which describes \nobligations under the \nEnvironmental Protection and \nBiodiversity Conservation act \n1999 Environmental Offsets \nPolicy. \n5 \nPossible Spam \neupoqala@eerr.namnerbca.c\nom \nSpurious web link provided.  \nComment appears to be spam.

The EP will describe the level of performance for these \ncontrol measures during activities and including emergency situations.   \nAn emergency response plan which identifies source control options \nincluding capping systems, will be developed and submitted as a part \nof the activity’s EPs. At this stage of the approval process, there will be \nconsideration of source control methods and technology in order to \ndemonstrate that the impacts and risks will be managed to ALARP \nlevels. \nHydrocarbons of the Scarborough, Jupiter and Thebe reservoirs \ncontain no measurable liquid condensate fraction. It is therefore \nexpected that there would be no, or negligible, liquid component in a \nloss of containment scenario.  In the event of a loss of well control, the \nresponse strategy detailed in the EP will be based on the risk, and the \nproperties of the released hydrocarbons. \nOn review of the merit of this \ncomment, Woodside considers \nthat the concern raised is \nadequately addressed and no \nmodification to the document is \nrequired. \n11 \n \n \nPrivate \n \n“I think that this project should go ahead with the caveat that \ncheaper gas is made available for Western Australia. \nWhat would be even better is that the AU government \ndevelops the fields, undertake all production and distribution \n/ sales of LNG.  That way Australia would have a \nsustainable income for years to come.  Not only that all \nfuture exploration and development of fields should be under \nthe control of the Australian government not a foreign \ngovernment or company.  \nWith this then could be the Australian engineering rig/ship \nbuilding capability to ensure jobs and growth for Australia.” \nWoodside is proposing to expand the Pluto LNG facility to process \nScarborough gas and work is underway on the design of a domestic \ngas plant at Pluto to facilitate supply to Western Australia.   \nAs an Australian company, Woodside has a proud history of developing \nresources and delivering long term benefits to the country.  \nIndependent economic modelling indicates tax and royalties payments \nfrom the proposed Burrup Hub projects will add up to $82 billion.   \nWoodside has also developed an Australian Industry Participation Plan \nfor the proposed Scarborough development.  This plan has been \napproved by the Australian Government and is designed to maximise \nopportunities for Australian businesses.  \nWoodside considers that no \nmodification to the document is \nnecessary. \n*EDO’s comments have been summarised and grouped in accordance with section headers provided in EDO’s submission.  \n \n--- Page 1081 ---\nScarborough – Offshore Project Proposal \n \nThis document is protected by copyright.

While some \nrepresentative images of each transect are provided in the Sections below, Appendix D provides \nadditional images of the benthic habitat and organisms seen along each transect in Area 3. \n3.3.1 \nArea 3a \nNotes provided by Neptune for Area 3a included: \n \nThe ROV crossed the proposed pipeline route in the vicinity of E336608, N7781312 at \napproximately 09:35.   \n \nThe ROV was on bottom at 09:25 and off bottom at 09:51. \n \nThe seabed was typically flat and comprised sand with subordinate bioclastic gravel. \nBenthic fauna included areas of soft corals, including large gorgonians and sponges as well \nas black ‘whip’ corals. \n \nThe seabed comprised a flat predominantly sandy seabed with benthic habitat in the form \nof areas of soft corals and sponges.   \n \nNo significant high relief habitat features were observed. \nAnalysis of video data by Advisian was undertaken and the following additional notes regarding \nbenthic habitat in this location are provided:  \n \nThe seafloor along Transect 3a was relatively flat and sandy with a light to high cover of \nbiologenic gravel and/or organic material over its entire length (continually changing). The \nseabed was a mosaic of bare substrate and low (~5%) to high (~75%) density cover of \nbenthic organisms (e.g. sponges / soft corals), changing every few meters. This was very \nsimilar to Area 2. Small undulations of the seabed and some small sand waves were \npresent on occasion, but no other regular bedforms such as sand ripples or sand waves \nwere apparent. Images are provided in Figure 3-14 and Appendix D. \n \nThe seafloor in the vicinity of the pipeline crossing (as identified by the time stamp \nprovided by Neptune) was flat and sandy with a low-medium density cover (~20%) of \nsponges and soft corals and this habitat was typical of the rest of the transect (see Figure \n3-13). \n \nBioturbation of the seafloor in the form of small cones, craters, burrows and small and \nlarge trails was apparent. This occurred over the entire transect length and indicates the \npresence of mobile organisms living within and on top of the seabed.  \n--- Page 113 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n \nNo significant moderate or high relief habitat features or areas which could clearly be \ndefined as consolidated hard substrate were observed. Some potential very low profile \noutcropping was seen, although this was hard to clearly define with the often high cover of \nbiologenic gravel and benthic organisms. The depth of the seafloor was between 75 m to \n76 m along the entire transect (refer to Figure 3-14). \n \nBenthic epifauna were present along the entire transect and occurred in patches which \nchanged continuously from low (~5%) to high (~75%) density. This benthic fauna \ncomprised a diverse array of sponges and soft corals with varying forms, sizes and colours. \nHydroids were also apparent on occasion along the transect length. Additional details and \nCATAMI classifications are provided in Table 3-7. High density benthic cover was seen in \nareas where biologenic gravel was high but also in areas of fine sediment. In addition, \nthere were areas with a high cover of biologenic gravel which lacked any benthic \norganisms. The detailed bathymetry shown in Figure 3-14 did not differ significantly over \nthe transect length. While there is some evidence of higher benthic cover in more rugose \nareas and less benthic cover in less rugose areas, this was not always the case as seen on \nthe video.   \n \nFish fauna diversity was quite high, and varying sizes of fish were seen amongst the \naggregations of corals and sponges and also over bare sandy seafloor. Identifications of \nfish were not undertaken as part of this assessment. Seastars and feather stars were both \npresent.  \nA summary of the habitat characteristics, flora and fauna seen in Area 3a is provided in Table 3-7. \nThis table also provides the CATAMI Species Codes for each seafloor feature and taxa that could be \nidentified.  \nThe benthic habitat in the location of the pipeline crossing (as per the timestamp provided by \nNeptune) is shown in Figure 3-13. The seafloor in this area was flat and sandy with a low-medium \ndensity cover (~20%) of sponges and soft corals.

Appendix E provides additional images of the benthic habitat \nand organisms seen along each transect in Area 4. \n3.4.1 \nArea 4a \nNotes provided by Neptune for Area 4a included: \n \nThe ROV crossed the proposed pipeline route around E342566, N7782035 at \napproximately 13:15.   \n \nThe ROV was on bottom at 13:01 and off bottom at 13:29. \n \nThe seabed was typically flat to undulating and comprised sand with subordinate bioclastic \ngravel. ‘Starved’ ripples occurred and typically had coarser gravel in their troughs. Benthic \nfauna includes sporadic areas of soft corals, including large gorgonians and sponges as \nwell as black ‘whip’ corals. Current scour moats are noted around some of the sponges. \n \nThe seabed comprised a flat predominantly sandy seabed which had a benthic habitat in \nthe form of isolated areas of soft corals and sponges.   \n \nNo significant high relief habitat features were observed. \nAnalysis of video data by Advisian was undertaken and the following additional notes regarding \nbenthic habitat in Area 4a are provided:  \n \nThe seafloor within Area 4a was typically flat sand with a high level of biologenic gravel of \nunknown origin. Small mounds, waves and undulations all < 50 cm in height were seen on \noccasion and mainly occurred around aggregations of benthic epifauna (i.e. sponges and \nsoft corals). Images are provided in Figure 3-20 and Appendix E. \n \nIn the vicinity of the pipeline route (as identified by the time stamp provided by Neptune), \nthe seafloor was typical of the area being flat and sandy with biologenic rubble and a \nmedium density cover (~30%) of scattered sponges and soft corals (Figure 3-19).  \n \nThe vast majority of the seafloor along the transect in Area 4a was scattered with sponges \nand soft corals of varying forms and sizes. Some occurred as individuals and more dense \nclusters (up to ~50% cover) of these organisms were also common. Large areas of bare \nsubstrate were quite uncommon in Area 4a.  \n \nNo significant moderate or high relief features, or significant areas of consolidated hard \nsubstrate, were present along the transect in Area 4a (i.e. they were not seen on the video \nnor can be seen on the transect map). However, like in Area 2 and Area 3, much of the \n--- Page 126 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \nseafloor was covered in a biologic gravel of unknown origin and this was quite dense at \ntimes. The depth along the Area 4a transect was around 76 m to 78 m (refer to Figure \n3-20). This transect was in close proximity to the transect in Area 3c (which occurred in \nwaters from 75 – 76 m).   \n \nBenthic epifauna were common throughout the entire Area 4a, scattered in low to medium \ndensity clusters (5% - 30%) for the most part but also commonly occurring in larger more \ndense clusters (up to ~50% density). Soft corals (including gorgonians and seapens) and \nsponges were abundant and diverse in their form and size. Other benthic epifauna \nincluded echinoderms (e.g. feather stars which were often attached to sponges/corals). \nAdditional details and CATAMI classifications are provided in Table 3-10. Like in other \nareas, the occurrence of benthic organisms could not be clearly predicted from any \nrugosity or other features shown on the detailed bathymetric map (Figure 3-20) nor were \nthey always associated with a certain substrate type (e.g. high biologenic gravel).  \n \nMobile fauna (mainly small bony fishes) were most common around the larger clusters of \nsponges and soft corals. Fish were not identified as part of this assessment. \n \nBioturbation of the seafloor in the form of small mounds and craters was evident along the \nentire transect length and provides evidence for the occurrence of mobile fauna (typically \ninvertebrates) living within and on the soft sediment seafloor.  \nA summary of the habitat characteristics, flora and fauna seen along the transect in Area 4a is \nprovided in Table 3-10. This table also provides the CATAMI Species Codes for each seafloor \nfeature and taxa that could be identified.  \nThe seafloor in the vicinity of the pipeline crossing in Area 4a (as identified by the timestamp \nprovided by Neptune) is shown in Figure 3-19.

Images are \nprovided in Figure 3-22 and Appendix E.  \n \nThe vast majority of the seafloor along the transect was scattered with a low to medium \ndensity cover (~5-30%) of sponges and soft corals of varying forms and sizes, although \nbare patches of sand were slightly more common than was seen in Area 4a. Medium \ndensity clusters of these organisms (up to ~40-50% cover) also occurred along the \ntransects length. Images are provided in Figure 3-22 and Appendix E. \n \nIn the vicinity of the pipeline route (as identified with the time stamp provided by \nNeptune), the seafloor was flat and sandy with biologenic rubble and a medium density \ncover of scattered sponges and soft corals (~30% cover). This habitat was consistent with \nthe rest of the habitat in Area 4b (refer to Figure 3-21). \n \nNo significant moderate or high relief features, or significant areas of consolidated hard \nsubstrate, were present along the transect in Area 4b (as seen on the video and on the \ndetailed bathymetric mapping; Figure 3-22). However, much of the seafloor in this area \nwas covered in a biologic gravel of unknown origin (with variable cover). The depth of the \nseafloor in Area 4b was around 74 m over the entire transect length. Rugosity along the \ntransects length was relatively consistent and given the consistent depth, any small \nbathymetric features seen on the map would be of a very small scale (Figure 3-22). \n--- Page 131 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n \nBenthic epifauna were common throughout the entire Area 4b, scattered for the most part \nin low density (ranging from ~5-20% cover), but also occurring in larger and more dense \nclusters of up to ~40-50% cover. Soft corals (including gorgonians and seapens) and \nsponges were abundant and diverse in their form and size. Other benthic epifauna \nincluded echinoderms (e.g. feather stars). Images are provided in Figure 3-22 and \nAppendix E. These shown that benthic organisms were common over most of the transect \nlength regardless of small scale bathymetry / rugosity or substrate type (e.g. bare soft \nsediment or biologenic gravel).  \n \nMobile fauna (i.e. bony fishes) were most common around the larger clusters of sponges \nand soft corals in Area 4c. A high diversity of fish fauna was observed on the video \nhowever; these species were not identified as part of this assessment.  \n \nBioturbation of the seafloor in the form of small mounds and craters was evident along the \nentire transect length providing evidence for mobile fauna (typically invertebrates) living \nwithin and on the soft sediment seafloor.  \nA summary of the habitat characteristics, flora and fauna seen along the transect in Area 4b is \nprovided in Table 3-11. This table also provides the CATAMI Species Codes for each seafloor \nfeature and taxa that could be identified. The seafloor in the vicinity of the pipeline crossing in Area \n4b (as per the timestamp provided by Neptune) is shown in Figure 3-21. This area was flat and \nsandy with biologenic rubble and scattered sponges and soft corals of about 30% cover. \nThe location of the transect in Area 4b in relation to detailed bathymetry, with georeferenced \nrepresentative images of benthic habitat, is provided in Figure 3-22. There were no consistent \npatterns seen in the occurrence of benthic organisms or substrate type in relation to rugosity, nor \nwere there significant changes in depth or rugosity.

Benthic \nfauna included sporadic areas of soft corals, including gorgonians and sponges. Current \nscour moats were noted around some of the sponges. \n \nThe seabed comprised a flat and predominantly sandy seabed which had a benthic habitat \nin the form of isolated areas of soft corals and sponges.   \n \nNo significant high relief habitat features were observed. \nAnalysis of video data by Advisian was undertaken and the following additional notes regarding \nbenthic habitat in Area 4c are provided:  \n \nThe seafloor within Area 4c was very similar to 4a and 4b, consisting of typically flat fine \nsand with a generally high cover of biologenic gravel of unknown origin. Small mounds, \nwaves and undulations all < 50 cm in height were seen on occasion, mainly around \naggregations of benthic epifauna (sponges and soft corals). Images are provided in Figure \n3-24 and Appendix E. \n \nThe vast majority of the seafloor along the transect 4c was bare soft sediment, however, \nsome areas were scattered with sponges and soft corals of varying forms and sizes. The \nmajority of these were smaller in their form, however, larger forms tended to increase in \noccurrence towards the end of the transect. The density of benthic organisms in Area 4c \nwas generally low (~5-15%) but some more dense clusters of these organisms also \noccurred towards the end of the transect (up to ~30% cover). The occurrence of sponges \nand corals in transect 4c was generally less than in Areas 4a and 4b. Bare sand was also \nmore common in Area 4c than it was in 4b and 4a (while Area 4b also had more bare sand \nthan Area 4a). Images are provided in Figure 3-24 and Appendix E.  \n \nIn the vicinity of the pipeline route (as identified by the time stamp provided by Neptune), \nthe seafloor was flat and sandy with biologenic rubble and a low density of scattered \nsponges and soft corals (~5%). This is shown in in Figure 3-23.  \n \nNo significant moderate or high relief features or significant areas of consolidated hard \nsubstrate were present along the transect in Area 4c (as indicated on the video and the \ntransect map with detailed bathymetry Figure 3-24). However, some of the seafloor was \ncovered in a biologic gravel of unknown origin. The depth of the seafloor in Area 4c \nranged between around 76 m to 78 m (refer to Figure 3-24). The eastern end of the \n--- Page 135 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \ntransect had a couple of smaller features relative to the rest of the transect which typically \nhad low rugosity, however, these were only small scale (i.e. ~1 m).  \n \nBenthic epifauna were diverse in Area 4c, as seen in Areas 4a and 4b, and were scattered \nthroughout the entire Area 4c. Some larger clusters of epibenthic organisms occurred on \noccasion and these were mainly towards the eastern end of the transect. These areas of \ndenser benthic fauna may be related to the small features which can be seen on the \neastern half of the transect map. Soft corals (which included but were not limited to \ngorgonians and seapens) and sponges in this area were abundant and very diverse in their \nform and size. Other benthic epifauna included echinoderms (e.g.  feather stars). Additional \ndetails and CATAMI classifications are shown in Table 3-12.  \n \nMobile fauna including bony fishes, sea stars and feather stars were most common around \nthe larger clusters of sponges and corals. Sea cucumbers were also seen on occasion on \nthe bare sand.  \n \nBioturbation of the seafloor in the form of small mounds, craters and large / small trails \nwas evident over the entire transect length, again providing evidence for mobile fauna \n(typically invertebrates) living within and on the soft sediment seafloor.  \nA summary of the habitat characteristics, flora and fauna seen along the transect in Area 4c is \nprovided in Table 3-12. This table also provides the CATAMI Species Codes for each seafloor \nfeature and taxa that could be identified.  \nThe benthic habitat in the vicinity of the pipeline crossing in Area 4c is shown in Figure 3-23. The \nseafloor was sandy and quite bare in this location which was consistent with much of the rest of \nthis transect. There was ~5% cover of benthic organisms in this location. \nA map showing the location of the transect in Area 4c in relation to bathymetry, along with \ngeoreferenced representative images of benthic habitat, is provided in Figure 3-24. The video \nanalysis and transect map for Area 4c both provide some indication of a higher density of benthic \norganisms occurring in the eastern half of the transect, the location of a couple of bathymetric \nfeatures on a relatively low rugosity seafloor.

Where flat, the seabed had an algae cover. Where undulating, the seabed was \ncharacterised by starved ripples and scour moats, typically around sponges. Benthic fauna \nincluded sporadic areas of soft corals, including gorgonians and sponges. \n \nThe seabed comprised a flat predominantly sandy seabed which had a benthic habitat in \nthe form of isolated areas of soft corals and sponges.   \n \nNo significant high relief habitat features were observed.  \n \nDue to strong currents and the ROV tether management it was not possible to run the \ntransect across the proposed pipeline route. No image of the pipeline crossing area is \nshown for this reason.  \nFurther analysis of video data by Advisian resulted in the following notes regarding benthic habitat \nin this location:  \n \nThe seafloor in Area 5a consisted of flat sand, often with an organic cover (likely bacterial \nor algae) or biologenic gravel component. The seafloor showed some slight undulation in \nplaces and scour marks commonly occurred around small ‘clusters’ of benthic epifauna (i.e. \nsponges and soft corals). No regular bedforms such as sand ripples or sand waves were \npresent in this location. Images are provided in Figure 3-25 and Appendix F. \n \nNo significant moderate or high relief features were present along the transect in Area 5a \nas identified during the video analysis or on the detailed bathymetric map (Figure 3-25). \nNo areas of consolidated hard substrate were present. However, some small and more \nexpansive areas of unconsolidated biologenic gravel resulted in the appearance of a \npartially-hard substrate. This gravel component was more common in the second half of \nthe transect however cannot be identified on the transect map. The transect was located in \nwater depths which ranged from around 74 m to 76 m (Figure 3-25). Rugosity was \ngenerally consistent over the entire transect length.  \n--- Page 140 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n \nWhile much of the seafloor was bare, benthic epifauna occurred sporadically along the \nentire transect length and sometimes occurred as small and diverse ‘clusters’ of sponges \nand soft corals. These organisms were often quite large and were very diverse in form. \nIsolated organisms also occurred and were more common in the second half of the \ntransect where the seafloor tended to have a higher biologenic gravel component. \nAdditional classification details and CATAMI codes are provided in Table 3-13. The \npercentage cover of benthic organisms (within the entire video frame) ranged from around \n5% to 40% (excluding any cover of biologenic gravel). The location of georeferenced \nimages with higher benthic cover on the transect map do correspond somewhat to areas \nwith slightly increased rugosity, however, video analysis found they were not restricted to \nthese areas. In addition, higher densities were found in areas with higher biologenic gravel \ncover and also areas without gravel and fine soft sediment.   \n \nMobile fauna was present and more common around these clumps of sponges and soft \ncorals. They included echinoderms (e.g.  sea stars, feather stars and sea cucumbers) and \nsmall bony fishes (unidentified and usually quickly moving out of the field of view of the \nROV). \n \nBioturbation of the seafloor was common over the entire transect length and usually \noccurred in the form of thin trails, small mounds or craters. These indicate that mobile \nfauna (typically invertebrates) live within and on the soft sediment seafloor.  \n \nDue to strong currents and the ROV tether management it was not possible to run the \ntransect across the proposed pipeline route. In addition, Area 5a was the only area which \nwas surveyed within Area 5.  \nA summary of the habitat characteristics, flora and fauna seen in Area 5a is provided in Table 3-13. \nThis table also provides the CATAMI Species Codes for each seafloor feature and taxa identified.  \nA map showing the location of the transect in Area 5a in relation to bathymetry, along with \nrepresentative images of benthic habitat is provided in Figure 3-25. While some images with \nbenthic cover do tend to occur in locations with slightly higher rugosity this variation in seafloor \nbathymetry is actually very small. No strong or consistent relationship between bathymetry / \nrugosity and the occurrence or density of benthic organisms could be inferred from the combined \nvideo and mapping analysis, with organisms occurring along the length of the transect and in areas \nwith higher biologenic gravel and also areas with fine soft sediment and no gravel.  \nAdditional images of benthic habitat and sessile organism in Area 5a are provided in Appendix F. \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 141 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \nHabitat \nFeatures \nDescription \nCATAMI  \nSpecies Code \nOccurrence \nSubstrate Type \nUnconsolidated (soft): Sand/mud (<2mm) \nUnconsolidated (soft): Pebble / gravel: \nBiologenic \n82001005 \n82001007 \n \nEntire Transect  \nEntire Transect \n \nBedform \nBioturbated \n82002005 \nEntire transect \nRelief \nFlat \n82003001 \nEntire Transect \nBioturbation \nBioturbation: Crawling traces: Thin trail \nBioturbation: Dwelling traces: Small mound \nBioturbation: Dwelling traces: Crater cone  \n81005001 \n81001003 \n81001012 \nOccasional \nbioturbation over \nentire transect \nBacterial mats \nBacterial mat \n80000000 \nAround ½ transect \nFlora  \nNil \nNA \nNA \nFauna \n \nEchinoderms: Feather stars \nEchinoderms: Sea stars  \nEchinoderms: Sea cucumbers \n \nSponges: Erect simple \nSponges: Erect laminar \nSponges: Erect branching \nSponges: Cup like \nSponges: Cup-likes: Cups \nSponges: Cups: Cup / goblet  \nSponges: Cup-likes: Tubes and chimneys  \nSponges: Crusts: Creeping / ramose \nSponges: Massive forms – simple \nSponges: Massive forms: Cryptic -  \nCorals: Black & Octocorals: Quill (seapen) \nCorals (unidentified soft corals) \nCorals: Fleshy: Arborescent  \nCorals: Non-fleshy: Bushy \nCorals:  Fern-frond: Complex   \nCorals: Black & Octocorals: Fan (2D)  \nCorals: Black & Octocorals: Whip  \nCnidaria: Hydroids \nFishes: Bony fishes \n25000000 \n25102000 \n25400901 \n10000916 \n10000913 \n10000915 \n10000909 \n10000910 \n10000919 \n10000911 \n10000917 \n10000904 \n10000908 \n11168918 \n11168000 \n11168911 \n11168908 \n11168915 \n11168912 \n11168917 \n11001000 \n37990083 \nDiverse ‘clumps’ of \nsponges and corals \nwere seen on \noccasion along the \nentire transect in \nArea 5 \n--- Page 142 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n             \n \n \n \n--- Page 143 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n             \n \n \n4 \nSummary and Discussion \nThe benthic habitat within five areas of the Montebello AMP was characterised through assessment \nof video collected by ROV. This habitat has been described and classified in accordance with the \nCATAMI Classification System. Area 1 which was the deepest location and was located in the \nvicinity of the KEF was most different, with a much lower cover of benthic organisms than Areas 2 \nto 5. Areas 2 to 5 were quite similar in depth and in nature, with some small differences in the \ndensity and occurrence of benthic organisms and in substrate type (e.g. variants of soft sediment \nbedforms and cover of biologenic gavel). A summary of findings for each area surveyed is provided \nbelow along with a discussion of the results in relation to the published values for the Montebello \nAMP and 125m Depth Contour KEF.  \n4.1 \nArea 1 \nArea 1 was selected to assess the benthic habitat at the ancient coastline 125 m depth contour KEF \nand to provide spatial coverage of the AMP. Area 1a was located within the KEF, however Area 1b \nand 1c were not. No potential features of the KEF (i.e. areas of hard substrate with high \nbiodiversity) were seen along any of the transects surveyed. The actual depth at the midpoint of \nthe transects in Area 1 ranged from 103.2 m to 126.4 m. Benthic habitat along all transects \nsurveyed in Area 1 were typically bare sand with various bedforms including flat bare sand, small \nripples (of 2D and 3D forms) and small ‘steps’ (<50 cm). Some areas of seafloor were bare, while \nothers were covered in a light bacterial mat and others were seen to have a cover of biologenic \ngravel (of unidentified origin). The cover of biologenic gravel changed continuously over the \ncourse of the transects. No moderate or high relief features or areas of consolidated hard substrate \nwere present within any transect. \nBenthic organisms (including sponges and soft corals) were present on occasion and generally \noccurred as single or low density aggregations of individuals. The cover of benthic organisms in \nArea 1 ranged from 0% to ~15% (being highest in Transect 1c). Slightly higher occurrences of \nbenthic organisms were noted in areas with a higher cover of biologenic gravel (although were in \nno way limited to these areas and this feature could not be identified by looking at the transect \nmaps). Furthermore, this relationship was not quantified. No relationship between bathymetry and \ndifferent habitat ‘types’ or the cover of benthic organisms was seen along individual transects. The \noccurrence and cover of benthic organisms and the location of different substrate types could not \nbe predicted from any obvious features on the bathymetric maps. Bioturbation of the seafloor was \nevident in all three transects in Area 1 indicating the presence of mobile organisms living on and \nwithin the seabed. Mobile organisms including fish, echinoderms and jellies, were also noted on \nthe video.  \nThe environmental values of the KEF refer to potential areas of hard substrate or rocky \nescarpments which may provide enhanced biodiversity or biologically important habitat in areas \notherwise dominated by soft sediments. However, no hard substrate or rocky escarpments were \nrecorded in Area 1 in the current study.  Nonetheless, the soft sediment habitat did support a \nnumber of epibenthic and mobile fauna in the form of corals, sponges, echinoderms and fish.   \n--- Page 144 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \n4.2 \nArea 2 \nArea 2 was selected to provide spatial coverage of the AMP in an area which may include ancient \ncoastline. The actual depth at the midpoint of each of the transects in Area 2 ranged from 70.6 m \nto 74.4 m. The benthic habitats present along all transects in Area 2 were very similar to each other. \nThe seafloor in Area 2 was relatively flat and sandy with a light to high cover of unconsolidated \nbiologenic gravel and/or organic material. Small undulations of the seabed were seen but no other \nregular bedforms such as sand ripples or sand waves were apparent. No significant high relief \nhabitat features, or areas of consolidated hard substrate, were observed in any transect. Some \nareas of seafloor were relatively bare while others included a low (~5%) to high (~80%) density \ncover of benthic organisms. This was true for all three transects. This benthic cover changed \ncontinually and often (within m’s) over each transect. Bioturbation of the seafloor in the form of \nsmall cones, craters, burrows, small and large trails was also apparent. Mobile organisms including \nfish, echinoderms and jellies, were also noted on the videos for Area 2. \nBenthic epifauna was present over the length of each transect, occurring in patches which varied \nfrom low (~5%) to high (~80%) density, and which changed continuously. All three transects were \nquite similar. Benthic fauna comprised a diverse array of sponges and corals with varying forms, \nsizes and colours. Hydroids and cnidarians were also apparent on occasion along the transect \nlength. Fish fauna were also common amongst the patches of sponges and corals. Higher cover of \nbenthic organisms were often seen in areas which had higher amounts of visible biologenic gravel, \nhowever this was also seen in areas which seemed to comprise more fine sediment with less or no \nbiologenic gravel. The generally common occurrence of benthic organisms in Area 2 may be \nrelated to the generally high rugosity which can be seen in all three transect maps. A decrease in \nbenthic cover on some occasions could be related to more expansive areas of lower rugosity (e.g. \nin Transect 2c) however this was not always the case.   \nThe high biodiversity of sessile and mobile organisms seen at depths of around 70 m – 76 m in \nArea 2 was in accordance with the natural values of the Montebello AMP in that the area surveyed \n‘includes diverse benthic and pelagic fish communities’. Area 2 may provide foraging habitat for \nmobile threatened fauna such as marine turtles and other fish fauna that feed on soft bodied \nbenthic organisms such as sponges and soft corals. \n4.3 \nArea 3 \nArea 3 was selected because it was identified as a point of interest in the AMP and along the \ntrunkline corridor where there are likely to be outcropping / subcropping calcarenite with shallow \nsediment cover and sediment ponds, along with sections of sandy bottom (KP165-170). The actual \ndepth at the midpoint of the transects in Area 3 ranged from 71.6 m to 73.8 m. The seafloor in \nArea 3 was relatively flat and sandy with a light to high cover of biologenic gravel and/or organic \nmaterial over its entire length (continually changing). The seabed was a mosaic of bare substrate \nand low (~5%) to high (~75% - in Area 3a) density cover of benthic organisms (e.g. sponges / \ncorals). Small undulations of the seabed and some small sand waves were present on occasion, but \nno other regular bedforms such as sand ripples or sand waves were apparent. No significant \nmoderate or high relief habitat features were observed on the video or can be seen on the transect \n--- Page 145 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \nmaps with detailed bathymetry. Any features seen are in the order of ~1 m and occur over \nrelatively large scales. Some potential outcropping was seen, although this was hard to clearly \ndefine with the often high cover of unconsolidated biologenic gravel and cover of benthic \norganisms. Bioturbation of the seafloor in the form of small cones, craters, burrows and small and \nlarge trails was apparent. Mobile organisms including fish, echinoderms and jellies, were also noted \non the videos for Area 3. Fish fauna diversity was quite high, and varying sizes of fish were seen \namongst the aggregations of corals and sponges and also over bare sandy seafloor. \nBenthic epifauna were present along the entire transect and occurred in patches which changed \ncontinuously from low (~5%) to high (~75%) density. Area 3a contained high density (~75%) \naggregations on occasion, however, Area 3b and 3c only reached a medium density (~50%). \nBenthic fauna comprised a diverse array of sponges and corals with varying forms, sizes and \ncolours. Hydroids and cnidarians were also apparent on occasion along the transect length. While \nsome indication for higher benthic cover in areas containing a higher cover of biologenic gravel \nand/or areas which appeared slightly more rugose on the transect maps was seen, this relationship \nwas not consistent and there were many occasions where a higher density of organisms was seen \non soft sediment with little gravel cover and also on areas of the transect maps which appeared to \nbe quite flat in relation to the rest of the transect.  \nThe high biodiversity of sessile and mobile organisms seen at depths of around 73 m – 76 m in \nArea 3 was in accordance with the natural values of the Montebello AMP in that the area surveyed \n‘includes diverse benthic and pelagic fish communities’. Although no clear outcropping / \nsubcropping of calcarenite was seen, areas of biologenic gravel with a medium cover of benthic \norganisms were common. Area 3, like Area 2, may provide foraging habitat for mobile threatened \nfauna such as marine turtles and other fish fauna that feed on soft bodied benthic organisms such \nas sponges and soft corals. \n4.4 \nArea 4 \nArea 4 was included to provide data to assess the benthic habitat adjacent to the Pluto pipeline, in \nan area that could potentially provide turtle foraging on hard substrate / subcrops (KP160-164). \nThe actual depth at the midpoint of the transects in Area 4 ranged from 74.5 m to 78.2 m. The \nseafloor within Area 4 was typically flat sand with a high level of biologenic gravel of unknown \norigin. Small mounds, waves and undulations all < 50 cm in height were seen on occasion and \nmainly occurred around aggregations of benthic epifauna (i.e. sponges and corals). The seafloor in \nArea 4 was scattered with sponges and corals of varying forms and sizes. Some occurred as \nindividuals with a low density cover (~5%) and more dense clusters (up to about 50% cover) of \norganisms were also seen and were more common in some transects (namely 4a and 4b). Areas of \nbare sand were present amongst the patches of epifauna and were more common in Area 4c than \n4b and again than in Area 4a. The switch between bare sand to benthic cover changed constantly \nand quickly however. Corals and sponges were abundant and diverse in their form and size. Other \nbenthic epifauna included echinoderms (e.g.  feather stars which were often attached to \nsponges/corals) and cnidaria (e.g. seapens). Mobile fauna (mainly small bony fishes) were most \ncommon around the larger clusters of sponges and corals. Bioturbation of the seafloor in the form \nof small mounds and craters was evident along the entire transect length. \n--- Page 146 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \nNo significant moderate or high relief features, or significant areas of consolidated hard substrate, \nwere present in Area 4 as could be seen on the video or transect maps. However, much of the \nseafloor was covered in a biologic gravel of unknown origin and this was quite dense at times. \nWhile at times the bathymetric maps provided some indication of increased cover of benthic \norganisms in areas with higher rugosity, this was not always the case. In general, Area 4a and 4b \nwere more rugose than 4c, and these two areas did appear to have a more consistent cover of \nbenthic organisms. However, within individual transects, a medium - high density of benthic \norganisms could be seen in areas that were not necessarily highly rugose (as indicated on the \nbathymetric maps), and in some cases, density was high in areas with expansive biologenic gravel \nand at other times was high on areas of bare soft sediment.  \nThe high biodiversity of sessile and mobile organisms seen at depths of around 74 m – 78 m in \nArea 4 was in accordance with the natural values of the Montebello AMP in that the area surveyed \n‘includes diverse benthic and pelagic fish communities’. Although no areas of consolidated hard \nsubstrate or subcrops were seen, the high epibenthic diversity, which included soft corals and \nsponges, could very well provide a foraging habitat for threatened marine turtles, along with other \nmobile fauna which are able to live at or travel to these depths.  \n4.5 \nArea 5 \nArea 5 was included for completeness to compare benthic habitat adjacent to the existing Pluto \npipeline at the eastern end of the AMP. The actual depth at the midpoint of the only transect \nsurveyed in Area 5 was 74.6 m. The seafloor in Area 5 consisted of flat sand, often with an organic \ncover (likely bacterial or algae) or a biologenic gravel component. The seafloor showed some slight \nundulation in places and scour marks commonly occurred around small ‘clusters’ of benthic \nepifauna (i.e. sponges and corals). No regular bedforms such as sand ripples or sand waves were \npresent in this location. No significant moderate or high relief features were present along the \ntransect in Area 5. No significant areas of consolidated hard substrate were seen. However, the \nbiologenic gravel resulted in a partially-hard looking substrate.  \nBenthic epifauna occurred sporadically along the entire transect length and generally occurred as \ndiverse ‘clusters’ of sponges and corals. These organisms were often large and were very diverse in \nform. The percentage cover of benthic organisms (within the entire video frame) ranged from 5% \nto ~40% (excluding any cover of biologenic gravel). No strong or consistent relationship between \nbathymetry / rugosity and the occurrence or density of benthic organisms could be inferred from \nthe combined video and mapping analysis, with organisms occurring along the length of the \ntransect and in areas with higher biologenic gravel and also areas with fine soft sediment and no \ngravel. \nMobile fauna were common around these clumps of sponges and corals. They included \nechinoderms (e.g. sea stars, feather stars and sea cucumbers) and small bony fishes. Bioturbation \nof the seafloor was common over the entire transect length and usually occurred in the form of \nthin trails, small mounds or craters. \nThe high biodiversity of sessile and mobile organisms seen at depths of around 74 m in Area 5 was \nin accordance with the natural values of the Montebello AMP in that the area surveyed ‘includes \n--- Page 147 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \ndiverse benthic and pelagic fish communities’. This area may provide foraging habitat for mobile \nthreatened fauna such as marine turtles and other fish fauna that feed on soft bodied benthic \norganisms such as sponges and soft corals. \n4.6 \nPrevious Benthic Surveys  \nBenthic habitat data from the North-West Shelf including the Montebello AMP has been collected \nin several previous surveys including the 2017 RV Investigator voyage (Keesing, 2019), the 2013 \nPilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP) surveys (Pitcher et al., 2016) and the 1982–1997 \nCSIRO North West Shelf (NWS) Effects of Trawling project (Sainsbury, 1988; 1991). General findings \nof these studies are provided below.  \nData used to describe benthic substrates and biota from the 2017 RV Investigator voyage were \nprincipally derived from still camera images. This study showed that substrate and topography in \nthe Montebello AMP was predominantly fine sand or a mix of fine and coarse sand. While deeper \nsites were often all coarse sand, some rubbly areas were observed at the shallowest sites. The \ngeneral topography was predominantly flat bottom with occasional bioturbated areas. Apart from \nthe most inshore site, most sites surveyed in the eastern section of the Montebello AMP had low \nnumbers of sponges, whips and gorgonians. Complex benthic filter feeder communities were \nlargely absent. The dominant filter feeders were hydroids, seapens and crinoids. The most \ncommonly recorded crinoid was Comatula rotalaria which is free living on sand rather than \nassociated with other filter feeders like gorgonians. One site surveyed was notable for the large \nnumbers of seapens present and most sites had large areas characterised by soft sediment \ndwelling crinoids or hydroids and seapens rather than the complex sponge and soft coral \ncommunities observed in the Dampier MP. \nThe CSIRO Effects of Trawling Project conducted between 1982 and 1997 included 21 transects in \nthe Montebello AMP. Substrate type was very similar across the whole of the AMP and similar to \nthe 2017 surveys, being predominantly fine sand or a mix or fine and coarse sand, with some sites \nhaving rubbly areas. Topography was mostly fine sand or fine sand with ripples. Three sites had \nlarge proportions of ridges or large ripples or very large ripples. All of these sites were located at \nthe far western side of the MP, two of these in the very south-western section of the MP. The biota \nrecorded in the CSIRO studies varied notably from that during the 2017 RV Investigator surveys. In \nparticular, the large proportion of sponges and small proportion of crinoids seen on the historical \nvoyages. However, two historical sites located in the eastern part of the MP where the 2017 \nsamples were taken also had a large proportion of images with no biota. \nThe Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP) project (Babcock et al. 2017) included habitat \nand biodiversity mapping in the region between North West Cape and Barrow Island and the \nMontebello Islands. One of the study components assessed benthic habitats and biodiversity in \nthis region (Pitcher et al. 2016) and included sites in what is now the Montebello AMP. Substrate \ntype recorded by video at the 2013 survey sites was either fine or coarse sand at four sites and \nrippled at two sites located in the south-western section of the AMP. The towed video sites \nsurveyed in the south-western part of the AMP had large proportions of video transects where no \nbiota was evident. Dense sponges occurred at shallower sites on the central southern and south-\n--- Page 148 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n \n \nwestern section of the MP, west of the islands and a site also in the south-western section had a \nlarge proportion of gorgonian habitat.  \nThe results of previous benthic studies in the Montebello AMP are largely in alignment with the \nfindings of the current study in terms of the benthic habitat recorded (typically low relief sandy \nseafloor (with various bedforms) with occasional rubbly areas increasing at sites more inshore) as \nwell as the dominant benthic organisms identified (which varied in diversity and density within and \nbetween survey areas, but typically included a wide variety of sponges and soft corals including \nwhips and gorgonians, hydroids, seapens and crinoids). \n \n \n  \n \n \n--- Page 149 ---\n \n \n \n \nWoodside Energy Ltd \nMontebello Marine Park Benthic Habitat Survey \nROV Analysis of the Scarborough Pipeline Route \n             \n \n \n5 \nReferences \nAlthaus F., Hill N., Edwards L., Ferrari R., et al.

People using this information in making\na referral may need to consider the qualifications below and may need to seek and consider other information sources.\nFor threatened ecological communities where the distribution is well known, maps are derived from recovery plans, State vegetation maps, remote\nsensing imagery and other sources.

Where distributions are well known and if\ntime permits, maps are derived using either thematic spatial data (i.e. vegetation, soils, geology, elevation, aspect, terrain, etc) together with point\nlocations and described habitat; or environmental modelling (MAXENT or BIOCLIM habitat modelling) using point locations and environmental data\nlayers.\nThe information presented in this report has been provided by a range of data sources as acknowledged at the end of the report.\nCaveat\n- migratory and\nThe following species and ecological communities have not been mapped and do not appear in reports produced from this database:\n- marine\nThis report is designed to assist in identifying the locations of places which may be relevant in determining obligations under the Environment\nProtection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

In the early stages of the distribution mapping\nprocess (1999-early 2000s) distributions were defined by degree blocks, 100K or 250K map sheets to rapidly create distribution maps.

In the early stages of the distribution mapping\nprocess (1999-early 2000s) distributions were defined by degree blocks, 100K or 250K map sheets to rapidly create distribution maps.

In the early stages of the distribution mapping\nprocess (1999-early 2000s) distributions were defined by degree blocks, 100K or 250K map sheets to rapidly create distribution maps.

In the early stages of the distribution mapping\nprocess (1999-early 2000s) distributions were defined by degree blocks, 100K or 250K map sheets to rapidly create distribution maps.

from selected activities associated with the proposed Scarborough gas field development \n(the Scarborough project), located in Western Australia’s North West Shelf region.  The Scarborough \nproject is being developed by Woodside Energy Ltd.  \nThree key noise generating activities associated with the Scarborough project have been identified by \n1. Floating Production Unit (FPU) installation and operation  \n2. Vessel operations associated with pipelaying \n3. Pile driving required for the trunkline connection near the Pluto LNG facility in Dampier. \nThis report has been prepared to inform an assessment of potential impacts from development \nactivities in Commonwealth waters, to be included in an Offshore Project Proposal (OPP) for \nsubmission to the Australian National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management \nAuthority NOPSEMA.  Since the activities in item 3 in the list above take place in State water, only \nitems 1 and 2 have been considered in this report. \nThis report outlines details of the noise model inputs, the noise propagation prediction methodology, \nand a summary of the noise predication results, presented in metrics that are relevant to the various \nmarine fauna species of interest.  The predicted underwater noise levels are compared to criteria \nfrom widely used scientific studies and international guidelines, as nominated by the project \necologist, to assist with the evaluation of noise impacts. \nA glossary of acoustic terms and symbols used herein is provided in Appendix A. \n2.0 \nPROJECT DESCRIPTION \nThe Scarborough gas field is located within the offshore area designated as Permit Area WA-1-R by \nthe National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator. The area is located approximately 380 km \nWNW of the Burrup Peninsula in the North West of Australia where water depths range between \n900m and 1000m.   \nWe understand that the Scarborough project proposes drilling of up to 22 subsea gas wells. It is \nproposed that wells will be tied back to a Floating Production Unit (FPU), with processing facilities on \nthe FPU enabling transport of the gas through a 420-kilometre-long trunkline to the Woodside \noperated Pluto LNG Facility. The trunkline and associated installation works will occur in both State \nand Commonwealth waters.  \n2.1 \nNoise generating activities \nA preliminary impact assessment has been carried out by Advisian (document reference US4A/B \nNoise Modelling Study Scope of work) which has identified activities associated with the proposed \nScarborough project that generate noise emissions. Of these, three key noise generating activities in \nCommonwealth waters have been identified by Advisian for detailed modelling to assess the risk of \nnoise impacts.  These impacts include: \n• \nChange in ambient noise;  \n• \nDisturbance to fauna behaviour;  \n• \nInjury/mortality to fauna; and   \n• \nChanges to the functions, interests or activities of other users. \nA description of the three activities is presented in Table 1.

Physiological damage that can lead to death or injury of the organism \n2. Permanent Threshold Shift (PTS), which is described as a permanent shift in hearing sensitivity \nand can be considered as an injury \n3. Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS), which is described as a temporary effect upon hearing and is \noften a recoverable impact \n4. Behavioural response, which may manifest as avoidance, or a change to movement \npathways/migration. \nFor each of the species hearing categories above, relevant noise criteria have been assigned to assist \nwith the assessment of noise impacts.  Details of the noise criteria are outlined in Section 4.0. \n4.0 \nNOISE IMPACT CRITERIA \n4.1 \nLegislation and policy \nThe Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) is the central \npiece of environmental legislation relevant to assessments of impacts on marine fauna.  It provides \nthe legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important areas, which are \ndefined in the EPBC Act as matters of National Environmental Significance (NES).  \nWhen a proposal has the potential to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental \nsignificance, the proposal is assessed on the basis of a ‘referral’.  A referral should contain sufficient \ninformation to provide an adequate basis for a decision on the likely impacts.  For noise impacts an \nassessment would commonly be made with reference to relevant performance criteria. \nThe EPBC Act Policy Statement 2.1 outlines performance criteria and provides a framework to \nminimise the risk of underwater acoustic impacts, however this only applies to seismic operations, \nand only considers impacts on whale species - there are no EPBC policy statements which address \nother underwater noise sources and marine species.   \nIn the absence of any other Australian specific underwater noise performance criteria, for this \nassessment, reference has been made to widely used scientific studies and international guidelines in \norder to evaluate the underwater noise impacts. These impact criteria sources have been nominated \nby the project marine ecologist. \n4.2 \nUnderwater noise criteria for marine mammals \nThe US Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has \nproduced guidance for assessing the effects of anthropogenic (human-made) sound on marine \nmammals.  Details are provided in the following sections. \n--- Page 337 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n9 \n4.2.1 Physiological impacts \nNOAA Technical Memorandum1 provides thresholds for the onset of permanent threshold shift (PTS) \nand temporary threshold shifts (TTS) 2 in marine mammal hearing for all underwater sound sources. \nThe guidance of the NOAA Technical Memorandum is commonly used in Australia to help evaluate \nthe effects of sound exposure on marine mammal hearing.  \nAuditory threshold shifts can be caused by both impulsive noise sources (e.g. piling or seismic \nairguns) and continuous noise sources (e.g. vessel noise).  When the source is impulsive, threshold \nshifts can be caused by peak exposure (momentary, high-level impulsive events such as pile strikes) \nor from cumulative exposure (lower noise levels over an extended period such as from vibro-piling or \nmultiple pile strikes). \nThe NOAA Technical Memorandum provide TTS and PTS onset thresholds for marine mammals using  \nLp,pk  and ‘SELcum’ assessment descriptors. The Lp,pk level is the highest un-weighted instantaneous \npressure level recorded during the measurement period, whereas SELcum is the species-weighted \ncumulative sound exposure level over a 24-hour period. Table 3 presents the current NOAA \nthresholds. Explanation of marine mammal auditory frequency weightings is provided in Appendix C. \nIt should be noted that the Lp,pk assessment of noise levels is relevant for impulsive noise sources \nonly.  SELcum assessment is applicable to both impulsive and non-impulsive (continuous) noise \nsources. \nImpulsive \nNon-Impulsive \nLp,pk * \nSEL(cum) † \nSEL(cum) \nHearing group \nTTS  \nPTS  \nTTS \nPTS \nTTS \nPTS \nLow-Frequency Cetaceans \n213 \n219 \n168 \n183 \n179 \n199 \nMid-Frequency Cetaceans \n224 \n230 \n170 \n185 \n178 \n198 \nHigh-Frequency Cetaceans \n196 \n202 \n140 \n155 \n153 \n173 \n* The Lp,pk is the un-weighted peak instantaneous pressure level \n† The SEL(cum) is the weighted cumulative sound exposure level over a 24-hour period \n4.2.2 Behavioural impacts \nBehavioural responses to underwater noise can vary significantly depending on species, the \nbackground noise levels, and the frequency content of the noise source. These effects can range \nfrom temporary avoidance of the noisy area to masking of biologically important sounds.  \n                                                           \n1 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2018 Revision to: Technical Guidance for Assessing the Effects of \nAnthropogenic Sound on Marine Mammal Hearing (Version 2.0) Underwater Thresholds for Onset of Permanent and \nTemporary Threshold Shifts. Available from: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-\nprotection/marine-mammal-acoustic-technical-guidance \n2 TTS in humans can be likened to the ‘muffled’ effect on hearing after being exposed to high noise levels such as at a \nconcert. The effect eventually goes away, but the longer the exposure, the longer the threshold shift lasts. Eventually, the \nTTS becomes permanent.  Long exposure TTS causing PTS in marine mammals is typically associated with continuous \nnoise sources but is unlikely when dealing with impulsive sources due to the understanding that there is TTS recovery in \nbetween pulses. \n--- Page 338 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n10 \nFor underwater impulsive noise such as impact piling, NOAA guidance3 states that behavioural \nimpacts can occur at levels of 160 dB re. 1 µPa rms, and as low as 120 dB re. 1 µPa rms for non-\nimpulsive noise. \n \nImpulsive \nNon-Impulsive \n \nLp,rms (dB  re. 1  μPa) \nLp,rms (dB  re. 1  μPa) \nBehavioural \n160 \n120 \n4.3 \nUnderwater noise criteria for fish  \nThe 2014 publication ‘Effects of Sound on Fish and Turtles’4 (herein referred to as ASA S3/SC1.4-2014) \nprovides comprehensive sound exposure guidelines for fishes and sea turtles.  ASA S3/SC1.4-2014 \nwas prepared by an ANSI-accredited Standards Committee Working Group of experts and was \nsponsored by the Acoustical Society of America.  \nASA S3/SC1.4-2014 outlines hearing category groups based on the way different non-mammalian \nmarine animals detect and respond to sound and provides sound exposure metrics for a ranges of \nsource types for noise impact assessment purposes.  ASA S3/SC1.4-2014 divides fishes and sea turtles \ninto five groups as follows:  \n• \nFish with no swim bladder \n• \nFish with swim bladder not involved with hearing \n• \nFish with swim bladder that is involved with hearing \n• \nSea turtles \n• \nEggs and larvae \n4.3.1 Physiological impacts \nASA S3/SC1.4-2014 provides guideline noise level criteria for different types of sound sources.  Sound \nlevels from a source that are above the guideline criteria are considered likely to result in the stated \neffect (mortality, injury etc).  \nA summary of the guideline noise level criteria from ASA S3/SC1.4-2014, for piling noise sources, is \nprovided in Table 5.   A summary of the guideline noise levels criteria from ASA S3/SC1.4-2014, for \nshipping and other continuous noise sources, is provided in Table 6.   \nWhere quantitative criteria have not been provided in the ASA S3/SC1.4-2014, the entry has been \nshown blank. \n                                                           \n3 https://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected_species/marine_mammals/threshold_guidance.html \n4 Popper et al, 2014, Sound Exposure Guidelines for Fishes and Sea Turtles: A Technical Report prepared by ANSI \nAccredited Standards Committee S3/SC 1 and registered with ANSI, ASA Press (ASA S3/SC1.4 TR-2014) \n--- Page 339 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n11 \n \n \nMortality and potential \nmortal injury \nRecoverable injury \nTTS \nGroup \nType of Fish \nLp,pk \nSEL(cum) \nLp,pk \nSEL(cum) \nSEL(cum) \nA \nFish: no swim bladder \n(particle motion \ndetection) \n213 \n219 \n213 \n216 \n186 \nB \nFish: swim bladder is \nnot involved in hearing \n(particle motion \ndetection) \n207 \n210 \n207 \n203 \n186 \nC \nFish: swim bladder \ninvolved in hearing \n(primarily pressure \ndetection) \n207 \n207 \n207 \n203 \n186 \nD \nSea turtles \n207 \n210 \n- \n- \n- \nE \nEggs and larvae \n207 \n210 \n- \n- \n- \n \n \nGroup \nType of Fish \nMortality and \npotential mortal \ninjury \nRecoverable \ninjury \nTTS \nA \nFish: no swim bladder (particle \nmotion detection) \n- \n- \n- \nB \nFish: swim bladder is not \ninvolved in hearing (particle \nmotion detection) \n- \n- \n- \nC \nFish: swim bladder involved in \nhearing (primarily pressure \ndetection) \n- \n170 dB rms for \n48 hrs \n158 dB rms for 12 h \nD \nSea turtles \n- \n- \n- \nE \nEggs and larvae \n- \n- \n- \n4.3.2 Behavioural impacts \nStudies on the behavioural impacts from noise on fish are very limited and there are no widely \naccepted or validate guideline criteria.  This is partly due to the practicalities of conducting such \nstudies in the field, as well as the potential for large variations in responses across all fish species.  \nGiven the lack of available evidence or validated criteria, quantitative guidelines for the behavioural \nimpact of fish are not provided in ASA S3/SC1.4-2014, and instead a subjective risk assessment \napproach is used.  For this reason, only physiological impacts on fish have been considered in this \nreport. Behavioural impacts for sea turtles are addressed in the following section. \n--- Page 340 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n12 \n4.4 \nUnderwater noise criteria for turtles \n4.4.1 Physiological impacts \nData on hearing by sea turtles is very limited and specific TTS noise threshold criteria are not \navailable currently5.

However, a \nnumber of established analytical methods are representative of current industry practice and are \nroutinely used for impact assessment purpose. These methods have been implemented in the \nproprietary dBSea software to produce noise contours which show the distribution of levels around a \nsource of noise. \nIt should be noted that modelling of underwater noise can be are highly sensitive to input \nparameters. Also, while the methods provide high accuracy for a specific environmental condition, in \npractice, propagation is highly variable and sensitive to temporal and spatial variations in \nenvironmental conditions (in contrast to the to the water condition simplifications which are \nnecessary for practical modelling purposes). \n5.2 \nModel input parameters \nTo predict underwater noise levels, the following factors have been considered: \n• \nSource noise level spectra based on in-water measurement or other suitable reference data, as \nprovided by Advisian. \n• \nSource locations and depths as provided by Advisian \n• \nThe noise levels are calculated using a dBSea propagation solvers. The particular solvers used for \neach scenario are outlined in the relevant sections below.  A description of solvers can be found \nin Appendix D.   \n                                                           \n5 NSF 2011 provides conservative safety radius of 180 dB re 1 μPa above which TTS or PTS is considered possible, \nhowever specific threshold criteria are not defined. \n6 Reference detail are required from Advisian  \n7 Reference detail are required from Advisian  \n--- Page 341 ---\nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n13 \n• \nBathymetry of the area as provided by Advisian (9 second longitude grid spacing, ~ 250mx250m) \n• \nThe yearly average sound speed profile variations with depth as provided by Advisian.

Common to \nall modelling scenarios. \nFor this report, three different modelling scenarios have been considered, each involving different \nsources, geographic locations and environmental inputs.  Each scenario is discussed in greater detail \nin the following sections.  \n5.3 \nScenario 1a – FPU installation \nFor this study, FPU installation refers to piling activity associated with the construction of mooring \nanchors for the FPU. \n5.3.1 Piling details \nThe mooring arrangement drawing provided by Woodside8 shows 20 anchor piles positioned around \nthe FPU site.  \nDetails of the piling properties, as provided by Woodside, are presented in Table 8. Installation details \n(strike rate, number of blows) has been provided by Woodside, as determined by a piling drivability \nassessment. \nParameter description \nValue \nPile length \n60 m \nPile diameter \n5 m \nWall Thickness  \n50 mm \nMaterial \nSteel \nWater depth  \n~950 m \nInstallation depth below sea floor (total driven \ndepth) \n60 m \nInstallation type \nImpact \nInstallation rate \n1 pile per day \nTotal blows per pile \n2752 (case #1) \n5.3.2 Source levels \nPiling noise level predications in underwater environments are commonly made on the basis of \nmeasured near-field source levels of similar piling operations (operations that have used comparable \npile sizes, pile types and in similar environments). A commonly used source for reference piling noise \nlevels is the CALTRANS Compendium of Pile Driving Sound Data9 (CALTRANS).  However, following a \n8 Woodside drawing reference 195369-MA-GAS-015.01 (rev 00) \n9 The document California Department of Transportation’s document ‘Technical Guidance for Assessment and \nMitigation of the Hydroacoustic Effects of Pile Driving on Fish’ (referred to as CALTRANS) Appendix I, Compendium of Pile \nDriving Sound Data, provides a summary of measured underwater sound levels for a variety of pile driving situations.    \n--- Page 342 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n14 \nreview of CALTRANS and other available literature, no suitable measured noise level data \ncorresponding to the specific configuration proposed could be found.   \nFor this study, reference has been made to the South Australia Pile Driving Guidelines10 (SA piling \nguidelines).  While this document does not provide specific details of measured piling noise data, it \ndoes provide guidance on the typical range of levels.  The SA piling guidelines state that ‘Typical \nsource levels range from SEL 170–225 dB re 1 μPa2·s for a single pulse….’  For this study, the SEL \nmaximum value of the SA piling guidelines range has been used to represent piling associated with \nthe FPU installation on the basis that the proposed pile size is at the upper end of the typical pile \ndiameter size range11.   It should be noted there can be significant variation between piling noise \nlevel measurements, even when measured at the same site (as a result of poor hammer strikes for \nexample) so the maximum values have been referenced to account for the potential upper emissions \nof the proposed piling operations. \nSource noise levels and other piling details used in this underwater noise modelling scenario are \npresented in Table 9.  The RMS noise levels in Table 9 have been estimated based on analysis of the \nmeasured data provided in CALTRANS.  \nModelling the sound propagation of peak noise levels requires complex numerical methods that take \ninto account multipath, multi-component (time, frequency, phase etc) interference effects from the \nseafloor, sea surface and other propagation variables.  Such methods require significant computation \npower and are generally not suited for practical use due to the significant processing times required.  \nAlternative methods that can estimate the Lp,pk levels based on the SEL have been developed to \novercome these issues.  Such methods typically overestimate the Lp,pk and are therefore considered \nto be conservative.  For this study, a simple linear regression method outlined in Lippert et. Al. (2015) \nhas been used to estimate the Lp,pk level based on the received SEL level, as calculated in the dBSea \nmodel. Since the estimated Lp,pk level varies with range, a single figure has not been shown in the \nsource levels in Table 9. \nspectrum is based on in-water measurements of impact driven steel piles12 between 31.5Hz – 20kHz, \nscaled to the levels provided in Table 9.   \nType \nSize and \nMethod \nSource Levels (@ 1m) \nPeak \nLp,rms, (dB re 1μPa) \nSEL(single strike), (dB re 1μPa2) \n Anchor \npile \nImpact driven \n5000mm steel \nSee discussion \nabove \n235 \n225 \n                                                           \n10 South Australian Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (DPTI), South Australia Pile Driving Guidelines, \nNovember 2012, Document: # 4785592 \n11 Pile noise source estimates are supported by analysis of the available large pile data in CALTRANS and reference to \nother publicly available studies (e.g. Barossa Area Development OPP - www.nopsema.gov.au/assets/OPPs/A598152.pdf) \n12 ITAP –Institut für technische und angewandte Physik GmbH: ‘Spektren der Vibrationsramme beim Umspannwerk’ \n(2011) \n--- Page 343 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n15 \n \n5.3.3 Source locations \nThe location coordinates for the noise sources and the assumed source depth are provided in \nworst-case scenario in terms of noise propagation. \nFor impact assessment purposes, a single representative pile location only (pile #10) has been \nconsidered in the noise model.

Review of the benthic substrate map indicates \nthat the sea bed in the vicinity of FPC location is described as ‘mud and calcareous clay’.

The results are \nsplit into tables based on the species and/or threshold type.  The results are presented in the form of \na distance from the source to the predicted noise level contour with a value equal to the threshold of \ninterest for each species and type of effect (referred to as the threshold contour).    \nSelected noise contour plots for each scenario are presented in Appendix G. The noise level contours \nrepresent the maximum predicted noise level across all water depths at each point (as opposed to \npresenting the predicted noise level for a single constant depth). This is often referred to as a \n‘maximum over depth’ result. \nThe distances presented in the tables below are stated in terms of a Rmax (the maximum radial \ndistance in any direction from the source to the threshold contour) and the R95 (the radius of the \ncircular area, equivalent to 95% of the total area encompassed by the threshold contour). \n6.1 \n Scenario 1a – FPU installation (anchor piling) \npiling). \n \n \n                                                           \n16 Hamilton, E.

The study has \nconsidered three scenarios which represent the main noise generating activities associated with the \ndevelopment.   \nNoise modelling has been carried out using dBSea software.  The model has taken into account \nvarious data inputs including the noise sources and locations, bathymetry data, sound speed profile \ndata and seafloor properties.  Suitable noise propagation solvers have been configured for each \nscenario.  \nThere are no prescribed underwater noise criteria that apply to the project.  To assist with the \nassessment of underwater noise impacts, reference has been made to noise level criteria from \nwidely used scientific studies and international guidelines. These impact criteria sources have been \nnominated by the project marine ecologist. \nThe results of the noise modelling have been presented in the form of a distance from the various \nnoise sources to the predicted noise level contour representing the particular threshold of interest.    \n \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 354 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n26 \nAPPENDIX A GLOSSARY OF TERMINOLOGY \n \ndB \nDecibel \nThe unit of sound level. \nExpressed as a logarithmic ratio of sound pressure P relative to a reference pressure  \nFrequency \nThe number of pressure fluctuation cycles per second of a sound wave.

The duration of TTS varies depending on the nature of the stimulus, but \nthere is generally recovery of full hearing over time. TTS in humans can be likened to \nthe ‘muffled’ effect on hearing after being exposed to high noise levels such as at a \nconcert. The effect eventually goes away, but the longer the exposure, the longer the \nthreshold shift lasts. Eventually, the TTS becomes permanent (PTS). \nUnderwater noise \nA sound that is unwanted by, or distracting to, the receiver underwater. \n \n \n--- Page 355 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n27 \nAPPENDIX B BIA OVERLAP WITH MODELLED AREAS \nSpecies \nBIA type \nScenario 1a \nScenario 1b \nScenario 2 \nPartial \nFull \nPartial \nFull \nPartial \nFull \nPygmy Blue \nWhale \nMigration \n9 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n \nDistribution \n8 \n9 \n8 \n9 \n8 \n8 \nHumpback \nWhale \nMigration \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \nGreen Turtle \nInternesting Buffer;Legendre Island \nHuay Island \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n8 \nInternesting buffer; Dampier \nArchipelago (islands to the west of the \nBurrup Peninsula) \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \nFlatback Turtle \nInternesting buffer; Dixon Island \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n \nInternesting buffer; Intercourse Is \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n \nInternesting buffer; Dampier \nArchipelago (islands to the west of the \nBurrup Peninsula) \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n \nInternesting buffer; Legendre Is, Huay \nIs \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n \nInternesting buffer; Delambre Is \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \nInternesting buffer; West of Cape \nLambert \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \nHawksbill \nTurtle \nInternesting buffer; Rosemary Is \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \nInternesting buffer; Dampier \nArchipelago (islands to the west of the \nBurrup Peninsula) \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n \nInternesting buffer; Delambre Is (and \nother Dampier Archipelago Islands) \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \nLoggerhead \nTurtle \nInternesting buffer; Rosemary Island \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \nInternesting buffer; Cohen Island \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n \n \n \n--- Page 356 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n28 \nAPPENDIX C MARINE MAMMAL AUDITORY WEIGHTING FUNCTIONS \nThe following extract from the NOAA Technical Memorandum provides an industry referred explanation of \nmarine mammal auditory weighting functions. \n \n \n--- Page 357 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n29 \n \n \n \n \n--- Page 358 ---\n \nRp 001 20181331 - Scarborough Gas Field  - Underwater Noise Report.docx \n30 \nAPPENDIX D PROPAGATION SOLVERS \nUnderwater acoustic propagation is commonly described mathematically by a partial differential called the \n“Helmholtz Wave Equation”.  The different solvers available in dBSea each employ various methods and \napproximations to yield a solution to the wave equation, i.e. the propagation loss. The propagation loss is \nused to make predictions of acoustic levels.  As such each solver has specific scenarios of applicability.  \nThe 3D levels predicted by dBSea are interpolated from 2D slices. All the solvers in dBSea can calculate \npropagation loss for range-dependent environments.  A range-dependant is an environmental where \nparameters such as, bathymetry, sound speed and/or seabed geoacoustic properties, may vary in range \naway from the source.  dBSea does not yet support elastic geoacoustic properties in the seabed. \nApproximations can be made where necessary to best derive equivalent fluid parameters to represent elastic \nseabed layers. \ngeneral the table follows a similar form to that presented in standard underwater acoustic textbooks17.   \n \nShallow water \nDeep water \nPropagation Solver Type \nLow Frequency \nHigh Frequency \nLow Frequency \nHigh Frequency \nParabolic Equations \n \n \n \n \nNormal Modes \n \n \n \n \nRays \n \n \n \n \nSymbol Key:  \n \nApplicable solver type, fit for purpose and widely used and numerically benchmarked \n \nApplicable solver type, however there may be limitation due to excessive computation \ntime or accuracy \n \nNone applicable  \nShallow water and deep water environments are distinguished by the extent that acoustic waves interact \nwith the seabed. Acoustic wave interact significantly with the seabed in shallow water environments. Typical \ntransition water depths are 50 m – 100 m.  Similarly, the cross over between high and low frequencies is not \na precisely defined and is also dependent on the water depth.

Refer to textbooks like Jensen et al. (2011)19 for further detailed \ninformation numerical implementations and description of each solver type.  \nD1 \ndBSeaModes \ndBSeaModes is a propagation solver is finite difference implementation of a normal mode algorithm.  The \nsolver can be used in range-dependent scenarios where there is variation in bathymetry, sound speed and/or \nseabed geoacoustic properties in range away from the source.  Range dependent calculations are based on \nthe outward propagating adiabatic approximation.  The adiabatic method is not applicable to scenarios \nwhere significant range-dependant variations in parameters occur. Care must be taken in applying \ndBSeaModes to range-dependent environments. \nD2 \ndBSeaPE \ndBSea’s parabolic equation solver (dBSeaPE) is a finite difference implementation of the parabolic equation \nmethod.  Parabolic equation methods are the preferred low frequency solvers for range-dependent \nscenarios and have been used extensively in research and commercial applications for underwater \npropagation modelling. The solver can incorporate range-dependent environmental parameters in \nbathymetry, sound speed and seabed geoacoustic properties into the propagation loss predictions. \nThe algorithm is implemented by calculating an initial starting sound field, which is source depth dependent, \nand is stepped out in range from the source using the PE method. dBSeaPE will use the dBSeaModes solver \nto generate the starting field. If the modal solver fails to converge to a results Greene’s starter is used.  If the \nmodal starter fails, the software will prompt with a message 'PE solver used analytical starter', which \nindicates that the software is using an analytical starter (i.e. Greene’s starter) for the specified frequencies \nand slice numbers.  \nD3 \ndBSeaRay \nRay tracing methods are family of numerical solvers that use a frequency approximation to reduce the \nHelmholtz equation to a form that can be solved numerically.  The ray solver forms a solution by tracing rays \nfrom the source out into the sound field. A large number of rays leave the source covering a range of angles, \nand the sound level at each point in the receiving field is calculated by combining the components from each \nindividual ray.  \nWhen multiple seafloor layers are present, rays are not split and traced into the seafloor. A complex \nreflection coefficient is calculated which is representative of the underlying layers, and this coefficient is \napplied to the ray at the point of seafloor reflection. \ndBSeaRay is used for time domain calculations. Instead of returning a transmission loss at each point in the \nslice, a list of ray arrivals is returned (with separate entries for each frequency). These arrivals lists can be \nused to calculate the effective time series at each point in the slice, which is then used to calculate peak, peak \nto peak, and frequency band SEL levels. \n \n \n                                                           \n19 Jensen, F.

Ltd (Woodside), to \nundertake a marine dispersion modelling study of proposed water discharges from the Scarborough \nProject’s Floating Production Unit (FPU). \nThe Scarborough gas resource, located in Commonwealth waters approximately 375 km off the Burrup \nPeninsula, forms part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, comprising the Scarborough, North \nScarborough, Thebe and Jupiter gas fields. \nAs Operator of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, Woodside is proposing to develop the gas resource \nthrough new offshore facilities. These will be connected to the mainland through an approximately 430 km \ntrunkline. \nThe Scarborough Project will involve the processing of hydrocarbons which will result in the production of \ncooling water (CW). \nThe principal aim of the study was to quantify the likely extents of the near-field and far-field mixing zones \nbased on the required dilution levels for chlorine in the cooling water (CW) discharge and temperature \ndifferential between the discharge and the ambient receiving water. This will indicate whether \nconcentrations of this contaminant and the temperature of the plume are still likely to be above stated \nthreshold levels at the limits of the mixing zones (i.e. are not predicted to be diluted below the relevant \nthreshold). \nTo accurately determine the dilution of the CW discharge and the total potential area of influence, the effect \nof near-field mixing needs to be considered first, followed by an investigation of the far-field mixing \nperformance. Different modelling approaches are required for calculating near-field and far-field dilutions \ndue to the differing hydrodynamic scales. \nTo assess the rate of mixing of the chlorine in the CW stream from the FPU, dispersion modelling was \ncarried out for flow rates of 165,600 m3/d (45 °C), 64,800 m3/d (57 °C) and 82,800 m3/d (60 °C) at discharge \ndepths of 0 m, 10 m and 30 m below the water surface. \nThe potential area that may be influenced by the CW discharge stream was assessed for three distinct \nseasons: (i) summer (December to February); (ii) the transitional periods (March and September to \nNovember); and (iii) winter (April to August). An annualised aggregation of outcomes was also assembled. \nThe main findings of the study are as follows: \nNear-Field Modelling \n• \nThe results show that due to the momentum of the discharge a turbulent mixing zone is created in the \nimmediate vicinity of the discharge point, which is 0 m (Cases C1, C4 and C7), 10 m (Cases C2, C5 \nand C8) and 30 m (Cases C3, C6 and C9) below the water surface. The surface discharges are shown \nto increase the extent of the turbulent mixing zone. Following this initial mixing, the positively-buoyant \nplumes are predicted to rise in the water column. \n• \nFor Cases C1, C4 and C7 (0 m depth discharge), the plume is predicted to plunge up to 14 m below \nthe sea surface, with the highest flow rate yielding the greatest plunge depth due to the vertical \norientation of the discharges. For the discharges at depths of 10 m and 30 m, the plumes are predicted \n--- Page 393 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage xxi \nto plunge up to 25 m and 43 m below the sea surface, respectively, with the highest flow rate yielding \nthe greatest plunge depths. \n• \nIncreased ambient current strengths are shown to increase the horizontal distance travelled by the \nplume from the discharge point. \n• \nFor a discharge at a 165,600 m3/d flow rate, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume \nunder annualised average current speeds is predicted for a discharge at 30 m depth as 75.0 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:52. \n• \nFor a discharge at a 64,800 m3/d flow rate, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume \nunder annualised average current speeds is predicted for a discharge at 30 m depth as 69.7 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:77. \n• \nFor a discharge at an 82,800 m3/d flow rate, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume \nunder annualised average current speeds is predicted for a discharge at 30 m depth as 59.8 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:59. \n• \nFor a discharge at 0 m depth, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume under \nannualised average current speeds is predicted for a 165,600 m3/d flow rate discharge as 5.7 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:6. \n• \nFor a discharge at 10 m depth, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume under \nannualised average current speeds is predicted for a 165,600 m3/d flow rate discharge as 11.1 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:17. \n• \nFor a discharge at 30 m depth, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume under \nannualised average current speeds is predicted for a 165,600 m3/d flow rate discharge as 24.5 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:52. \n• \nFor each combination of discharge flow rate and depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the \nplume is the strength of the ambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach \nthe surface (or trapping depth, at which the predictions of dispersion are halted due to the plume reaching \nequilibrium with the ambient receiving water) closer to the discharge point, which slows the rate of \ndilution. \n• \nThe predictions of dilution rely on the persistence of current speed and direction over time and do not \naccount for any build-up of plume concentrations due to slack currents or current reversals. \n• \nThe results for each combination of discharge flow rate and depth indicate that the chlorine constituent \nof the CW discharge is not expected to reach the required levels of dilution in the near field mixing \nzone. \n• \nThe temperature differential between the plume and the ambient water meets the required criterion in \nall conditions for Cases C2, C3, C6 and C9, and in the stronger-current simulations for Cases C1, C5 \nand C8. For Cases C4 and C7, however, compliance with the temperature differential criterion is not \nachieved. \n• \nSome failures to reach the required threshold concentration and temperature are attributable to the \nplume rapidly breaking the surface. \n--- Page 394 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage xxii \nFar-Field Modelling \n• \nFor Cases C1 and C3, dilution to reach threshold concentration is achieved for chlorine within an area \nof influence extending up to 1.79 km and 2.47 km, respectively, at the 99th percentile. For Cases C4 \nand C6, the maximum spatial extents of the relevant dilution contour are up to 0.62 km and 0.63 km, \nrespectively, at the 99th percentile. \n• \nFor Cases C1 and C3, the areas of exposure defined by the relevant dilution contour are predicted to \nreach maximums of 4.59 km2 and 6.56 km2, respectively, at the 99th percentile. For Cases C4 and C6, \nthe corresponding maximum areas of exposure are up to 0.40 km2 and 0.68 km2, respectively, at the \n99th percentile. \n• \nMaximum depths reached by. the discharges are predicted as 8 m, 38 m, 6 m and 38 m for Cases C1, \nC3, C4 and C6, respectively. \n• \nBecause the 3 °C plume-ambient temperature differential requirement is forecast to be met within a \ndistance of 115 m at the 99th percentile in any case, the limiting factor for the plume’s area of influence \nwill be defined by its chlorine constituent rather than its temperature. \nKey Observations \n• \nDue to the similarity in typical magnitude of the hindcast currents throughout the depth range of \ndischarges under consideration, predicted outcomes are broadly similar. \n• \nThe greater variability in surface-layer currents may promote the highest levels of mixing and dilution. \n• \nBecause the discharge will be initially positively buoyant, it will rise in the water column and may \nresurface in the vicinity of the discharge point prior to acclimation with ambient receiving water \nconditions. This outcome is particularly likely for the surface discharge. \n• \nOutcomes show that below-threshold chlorine concentrations are achieved closer to the discharge \npoint for a flow rate of 64,800 m3/d than for a higher flow rate of 165,600 m3/d. This is attributable to \nthe fact that initial peak chlorine concentrations in the water column are lower in the former case, which \nreduces the average concentrations likely to be recorded in each model grid cell during episodes of \nrecirculation and pooling. \n \n--- Page 395 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 1 \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \n1.1 \nBackground \nRPS was commissioned by Advisian Pty Ltd (Advisian), on behalf of Woodside Energy Ltd (Woodside), to \nundertake a marine dispersion modelling study of proposed water discharges from the Scarborough \nProject’s Floating Production Unit (FPU). \nThe Scarborough gas resource, located in Commonwealth waters approximately 375 km off the Burrup \nPeninsula, forms part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, comprising the Scarborough, North \nScarborough, Thebe and Jupiter gas fields. \nAs Operator of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, Woodside is proposing to develop the gas resource \nthrough new offshore facilities.

The limits of the \nnear-field mixing zone are defined by the area where the levels of mixing and dilution are controlled by the \nplume’s initial jet momentum and the buoyancy flux, resulting from density differences between the plume \nand the receiving water. When the plume encounters a boundary such as the water surface, near-field \nmixing is complete. At this point, the plume is considered to enter the far-field mixing zone. \nThe scope of the modelling included the following components: \n• \nCollation of a suitable three-dimensional, spatially-varying current data set surrounding the FPU \nlocation for a ten-year (2006-2015) hindcast period. The current data set included the combined \ninfluence of drift and tidal currents and was suitably long as to be indicative of interannual variability in \nocean currents. The current data set was validated against metocean data collected in the \nScarborough Project area. \n• \nDerivation of statistical distributions for the current speed and directions for use in the near-field \nmodelling. Analyses included percentile distributions and development of current roses. This analysis \nwas important to ensure that current data samples applied in the dispersion model were statistically \nrepresentative. \n• \nCollation of seasonally-varying vertical water density profiles at the FPU location for use as input to \nthe dispersion models. \n• \nNear-field modelling conducted for each unique discharge to assess the initial mixing of the discharge \ndue to turbulence and subsequent entrainment of ambient water. This modelling was conducted at \nhigh spatial and temporal resolution (scales of metres and seconds, respectively). \n• \nOutcomes from the near-field modelling included estimates of the width, shape and orientation of the \nplumes, and resulting contaminant concentrations and dilutions, for each discharge at a range of \nincident current speeds. \n• \nEstablishment of a far-field dispersion model to repeatedly assess discharge scenarios under different \nsample conditions, with each sample represented by a unique time-sequence of current flow, chosen \nat random from the time series of current data. \n• \nAnalysis of the results of all simulations to quantify, by return frequency, the potential extent and shape \nof the mixing zone. \n--- Page 399 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 5 \n2 \nMODELLING METHODS \n2.1 \nNear-Field Modelling \n2.1.1 Overview \nNumerical modelling was applied to quantify the area of influence of CW water discharges, in terms of the \ndistribution of the maximum contaminant concentrations that might occur with distance from the source \ngiven defined discharge configurations, source concentrations, and the distribution of the metocean \nconditions affecting the discharge location. \nThe dispersion of the CW discharge will depend, initially, on the geometry and hydrodynamics of the \ndischarges themselves, where the induced momentum and buoyancy effects dominate over background \nprocesses. This region is generally referred to as the near-field zone and is characterised by variations over \nshort time and space scales. As the discharges mix with the ambient waters, the momentum and buoyancy \nsignatures are eroded, and the background – or ambient – processes become dominant. \nThe shape and orientation of the discharged water plumes, and hence the distribution and dilution rate of \nthe plume, will vary significantly with natural variation in prevailing water currents. Therefore, to best \ncalculate the likely outcomes of the discharges, it is necessary to simulate discharge under a statistically \nrepresentative range of current speeds representative of the FPU location. \n2.1.2 Description of Near-Field Model: Updated Merge \nThe near-field mixing and dispersion of the water discharge was simulated using the Updated Merge (UM3) \nflow model. The UM3 model is a three-dimensional Lagrangian steady-state plume trajectory model \ndesigned for simulating single and multiple-port submerged discharges in a range of configurations, \navailable within the Visual Plumes modelling package provided by the United States Environmental \nProtection Agency (Frick et al., 2003). The UM3 model was selected because it has been extensively tested \nfor various discharges and found to predict observed dilutions more accurately (Roberts & Tian, 2004) than \nother near-field models (i.e. RSB and CORMIX). \nIn the UM3 model, the equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are solved at each time \nstep, giving the dilution along the plume trajectory. To determine the change of each term, UM3 follows the \nshear (or Taylor) entrainment hypothesis and the projected-area-entrainment (PAE) hypothesis, which \nquantifies forced entrainment in the presence of a background ocean current. The flows begin as round \nbuoyant jets and can merge to a plane buoyant jet (Carvalho et al., 2002). Model output consists of plume \ncharacteristics including centreline dilution, rise-rate, width, centreline height and plume diameter. Dilution \nis reported as the “effective dilution”, the ratio of the initial concentration to the concentration of the plume \nat a given point, following Baumgartner et al. (1994). \nThe near-field zone ends where the discharged plume reaches a physical boundary or assumes the same \ndensity as the ambient water. \nthe idealised representation of the discharge phases. \n \n \n--- Page 400 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 6 \n \nConceptual diagram showing the general behaviour of positively buoyant discharge. \n \n2.1.3 Setup of Near-Field Model \n2.1.3.1 Discharge Characteristics \nThe CW discharge characteristics for Cases C1 to C9 are summarised in Table 2.1. \nCases C1 to C3 were assumed to occur at depths of 0 m below mean sea level (BMSL), 10 m BMSL and \n30 m BMSL, respectively. The flow was assumed to occur through a single outlet of 1.4 m diameter at a \nrate of 165,600 m3/d and have a salinity and temperature of 35 parts per thousand (ppt) and 45 °C, \nrespectively. \nCases C4 to C6 were assumed to occur at depths of 0 m, 10 m and 30 m BMSL, respectively. The flow \nwas assumed to occur through a single outlet of 1.4 m diameter at a rate of 64,800 m3/d and have a salinity \nand temperature of 35 parts per thousand (ppt) and 57 °C, respectively. \nCases C7 to C9 were assumed to occur at depths of 0 m, 10 m and 30 m BMSL, respectively.

In \nthis case, concentrations near the discharge point can be increased due to the discharge plume mixing with \nthe remnant plume from an earlier time. This may be a potential source of episodic increases in pollutant \nconcentrations in the receiving waters. \n2.2.2 Description of Far-Field Model: MUDMAP \nThe mixing and dispersion of the discharges was predicted using the three-dimensional discharge and \nplume behaviour model, MUDMAP (Koh & Chang, 1973; Khondaker, 2000). \nThe far-field calculation (passive dispersion stage) employs a particle-based, random walk procedure. Any \nchemicals/constituents within the discharge stream are represented by a sample of Lagrangian particles. \nThese particles are moved in three dimensions over each subsequent time step according to the prevailing \nlocal current data as well as horizontal and vertical mixing coefficients. \nMUDMAP treats the Lagrangian particles as conservative tracers (i.e. they are not removed over time to \naccount for chemical interactions, decay or precipitation). Predicted concentrations will therefore be \nconservative overestimates where these processes actually do occur. Each particle represents a proportion \nof the discharge, by mass, and particles are released at a given rate to represent the rate of the discharge \n(mass per unit time). Concentrations of constituents are predicted over time by counting the number of \nparticles that occur within a given depth level and grid square and converting this value to mass per unit \nvolume. \n--- Page 405 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 11 \nThe system has been extensively validated and applied for discharge operations in Australian waters (e.g. \nBurns et al., 1999; King & McAllister, 1997, 1998). \n2.2.3 Stochastic Modelling \nA stochastic modelling procedure was applied in the far-field modelling to sample a representative set of \nconditions that could affect the distribution of constituents. This approach involves multiple (25) simulations \nof a given discharge scenario and season, with each simulation being carried out under a randomly-\nselected period of currents. This methodology ensures that the calculated movement and fate of each \ndischarge is representative of the range of prevailing currents at the discharge location.

The CW discharge characteristics for the selected cases (C1, C3, C4 and C6) are summarised in \n \n \n--- Page 406 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 12 \nSummary of far-field CW discharge modelling assumptions. \nParameter \nCase C1 \nCase C3 \nCase C4 \nCase C6 \nHindcast modelling \nperiod \n2006-2015 \nSeasons \nSummer (December to February) \nTransitional (March and September to November) \nWinter (April to August) \nAnnual \nFlow rate (m3/d) \n165,600 \n64,800 \nDischarge depth (m) \n0 \n30 \n0 \n30 \nDischarge salinity \n(ppt) \n35 \nDischarge \ntemperature (°C) \n45 °C \n57 °C \nNumber of \nsimulations \n75 (25 per season) \nSimulated discharge \ntype \nContinuous \nSimulated discharge \nperiod (days) \n5 \n \n2.2.4.2 Mixing Parameters \nThe horizontal and vertical dispersion coefficients represent the mixing and diffusion caused by turbulence, \nboth of which are sub-grid-scale processes. Both coefficients are expressed in units of rate of area change \nper second (m2/s). Increasing the horizontal dispersion coefficient will increase the horizontal spread of the \ndischarge plume and decrease the centreline concentrations faster. Increasing the vertical dispersion \ncoefficient spreads the discharge across the vertical layers (or depths) faster. \nSpatially constant, conservative dispersion coefficients of 0.15 m2/s and 0.00005 m2/s were used to control \nthe spreading of the CW plume in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Each of the mixing \nparameters was selected following extensive sensitivity testing to recreate the plume characteristics \npredicted by the near-field modelling. It would be expected that the in-situ mixing dynamics would be greater \nunder average and high energy conditions by a factor of 10 (King & McAllister, 1997, 1998) and thus the \nfar-field model results are designed to produce a worst-case result for concentration extents. \n2.2.4.3 Grid Configuration \nMUDMAP uses a three-dimensional grid to represent the geographic region under study (water depth and \nbathymetric profiles). Due to the rapid mixing and small-scale effect of the effluent discharge, it was \nnecessary to use a fine grid with a resolution of 40 m x 40 m to track the movement and fate of the discharge \nplume. The extent of the grid region measured approximately 40 km (longitude or x-axis) by 40 km (latitude \nor y-axis), which was subdivided horizontally into 1,000 x 1,000 cells. The vertical resolution was set to 2 m. \n--- Page 407 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 13 \n2.2.5 Regional Ocean Currents \n2.2.5.1 Background \nThe area of interest for this study is typified by strong tidal flows over the shallower regions, particularly \nalong the inshore region of the North West Shelf and among the island groups stretching from the Dampier \nArchipelago to the North West Cape. However, the offshore regions with water depths exceeding 100-\n200 m experience significant large-scale drift currents. These drift currents can be relatively strong (1-2 \nknots) and complex, manifesting as a series of eddies, meandering currents and connecting flows. These \noffshore drift currents also tend to persist longer (days to weeks) than tidal current flows (hours between \nreversals) and thus will have greater influence upon the net trajectory of slicks over time scales exceeding \na few hours. \nWind shear on the water surface also generates local-scale currents that can persist for extended periods \n(hours to days) and result in long trajectories. Hence, the current-induced transport of pollutants can be \nvariably affected by combinations of tidal, wind-induced and density-induced drift currents. Depending on \ntheir local influence, it is critical to consider all these potential advective mechanisms to rigorously \nunderstand patterns of potential transport from a given discharge location. \nTo appropriately allow for temporal and spatial variation in the current field, dispersion modelling requires \nthe current speed and direction over a spatial grid covering the potential migration of pollutants. As \nmeasured current data is not available for simultaneous periods over a network of locations covering the \nwide area of this study, the analysis relied upon hindcasts of the circulation generated by numerical \nmodelling. Estimates of the net currents were derived by combining predictions of the drift currents, \navailable from mesoscale ocean models, with estimates of the tidal currents generated by an RPS model \nset up for the study area. \n2.2.5.2 Mesoscale Circulation Model \nRepresentation of the drift currents that affect the area were available from the output of the BRAN (Bluelink \nReANalysis; Oke et al., 2008, 2009; Schiller et al., 2008) ocean model, which is sponsored by the Australian \nGovernment through the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), Royal Australian Navy, and \nCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). BRAN is a data-assimilative, \nthree-dimensional ocean model that has been run as a hindcast for many periods and is now used for \nocean forecasting (Schiller et al., 2008). \nThe BRAN predictions for drift currents are produced at a horizontal spatial resolution of approximately 0.1° \nover the region, at a frequency of once per day, averaged over the 24-hour period. Hence, the BRAN model \ndata provides estimates of mesoscale circulation with horizontal resolution suitable to resolve eddies of a \nfew tens of kilometres’ diameter, as well as connecting stream currents of similar spatial scale. Drift currents \nthat are represented over the inner shelf waters in the BRAN data are principally attributable to wind induced \ndrift. \nThere are several versions of the BRAN database available. The latest BRAN simulation spans the period \nof January 1994 to August 2016. From this database, time series of current speed and direction were \nextracted for all points in the model domain for the years 2006-2015 (inclusive). The data was assumed to \nbe a suitably representative sample of the current conditions over the study area for future years. \n--- Page 408 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 14 \nto the FPU location. Note that the convention for defining current direction is the direction towards which \nthe current flows. \nThe data shows that current speeds and directions vary between seasons. In general, during transitional \nmonths (March and September to November) currents have the strongest average speed (0.22 m/s with a \nmaximum of 0.56 m/s) and tend to flow south-east. During winter (April to August), current flow conditions \nare more variable, with lower average speed (0.21 m/s with a maximum of 0.53 m/s). During summer \n(December to February), the current flow occurs in a predominantly south/south-westerly direction with the \nlowest average speed (0.20 m/s with a maximum of 0.46 m/s). \n \n \nSeasonal current distribution (2006-2015, inclusive) derived from the BRAN database \nnear to the proposed FPU location. The colour key shows the current magnitude, the \ncompass direction provides the direction towards which the current is flowing, and the \nsize of the wedge gives the percentage of the record. \n \n2.2.5.3 Tidal Circulation Model \nAs the BRAN model does not include tidal forcing, and because the data is only available at a daily \nfrequency, a tidal model was developed for the study region using RPS’ three-dimensional hydrodynamic \nmodel, HYDROMAP. \nThe model formulations and output (current speed, direction and sea level) of this model have been \nvalidated through field measurements around the world for more than 25 years (Isaji & Spaulding, 1984, \n1986; Isaji et al., 2001; Zigic et al., 2003). HYDROMAP current data has also been widely used as input to \nforecasts and hindcasts of oil spill migrations in Australian waters. This modelling system forms part of the \nNational Marine Oil Spill Contingency Plan for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA, 2002). \nHYDROMAP simulates the flow of ocean currents within a model region due to forcing by astronomical \ntides, wind stress and bottom friction. The model employs a sophisticated dynamically nested-gridding \nstrategy, supporting up to six levels of spatial resolution within a single domain. This allows for higher \n--- Page 409 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 15 \nresolution of currents within areas of greater bathymetric and coastline complexity, or of particular interest \nto a study. \nThe numerical solution methodology of HYDROMAP follows that of Davies (1977a, 1977b) with further \ndevelopments for model efficiency by Owen (1980) and Gordon (1982). A more detailed presentation of the \nmodel can be found in Isaji & Spaulding (1984). \nA HYDROMAP model was established over a domain that extended approximately 3,300 km east-west by \n3,100 km north-south over the eastern Indian Ocean. The grid extends beyond Eucla in the south and \nbeyond Bathurst Island in the north (Figure 2.3). \nFour layers of sub-gridding were applied to provide variable resolution throughout the domain. The \nresolution at the primary level was 15 km. The finer levels were defined by subdividing these cells into 4, \n16 and 64 cells, resulting in resolutions of 7.5 km, 3.75 km and 1.88 km. The finer grids were allocated in \na step-wise fashion to areas where higher resolution of circulation patterns was required to resolve flows \nthrough channels, around shorelines or over more complex bathymetry. Approximately 98,600 cells were \nused to define the region. \nBathymetric data used to define the three-dimensional shape of the study domain was extracted from the \nCMAP electronic chart database and supplemented where necessary with manual digitisation of chart data \nsupplied by the Australian Hydrographic Office. Depths in the domain ranged from shallow intertidal areas \nthrough to approximately 7,200 m. \nOcean boundary data for the HYDROMAP model was obtained from the TOPEX/Poseidon global tidal \ndatabase (TPXO7.2) of satellite-measured altimetry data, which provided estimates of tidal amplitudes and \nphases for the eight dominant tidal constituents (designated as K2, S2, M2, N2, K1, P1, O1 and Q1) at a \nhorizontal scale of approximately 0.25°. Using the tidal data, sea surface heights are firstly calculated along \nthe open boundaries at each time step in the model. \nThe TOPEX/Poseidon satellite data is produced, and quality controlled by the US National Atmospheric \nand Space Agency (NASA). The satellites, equipped with two highly accurate altimeters capable of taking \nsea level measurements accurate to less than ±5 cm, measured oceanic surface elevations (and the \nresultant tides) for over 13 years (1992-2005). In total, these satellites carried out more than 62,000 orbits \nof the planet. The TOPEX/Poseidon tidal data has been widely used amongst the oceanographic \ncommunity, being the subject of more than 2,100 research publications (e.g. Andersen, 1995; Ludicone et \nal., 1998; Matsumoto et al., 2000; Kostianoy et al., 2003; Yaremchuk & Tangdong, 2004; Qiu & Chen, \n2010). As such, the TOPEX/Poseidon tidal data is considered suitably accurate for this study. \nFor the purpose of verification of the tidal predictions, the model output was compared against independent \npredictions of tides using the XTide database (Flater, 1998). The XTide database contains harmonic tidal \nconstituents derived from measured water level data at locations around the world. Of more than 40 tidal \nstations within the HYDROMAP model domain, ten were used for comparison. \nWater level time series for these locations are shown in Figure 2.4 for a one-month period (January 2005). \nAll comparisons show that the model produces a very good match to the known tidal behaviour for a wide \nrange of tidal amplitudes and clearly represents the varying diurnal and semi-diurnal nature of the tidal \nsignal. \nThe model skill was further evaluated through a comparison of the predicted and observed tidal \nconstituents, derived from an analysis of model-predicted time-series at each location. A scatter plot of the \nobserved and modelled amplitude (top) and phase (bottom) of the five dominant tidal constituents (S2, M2, \n--- Page 410 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 16 \nN2, K1 and O1) is presented in Figure 2.5.

Any dilution rates indicated in red show that suitable dilution is not achieved during the near-field \nstage for at least one current-speed case. \ndilution and temperature of the plume under varying discharge rates (165,600 m3/day, 64,800 m3/day and \n82,800 m3/day), depths (0 m, 10 m and 30 m), seasonal conditions (summer, transitional, winter and annual) \nand current speeds (weak, medium and strong). The figures show the predicted horizontal distances travelled \nby the plume before the trapping depth is reached (i.e. before the plume becomes neutrally buoyant). \nIn each figure, the plots have been arranged to: (i) demonstrate the variation in predicted outcomes for the \nsame discharge at different depths under identical current conditions (Sections 3.1.3.1, 3.1.3.2 and 3.1.3.3); \nand (ii) demonstrate the variation in predicted outcomes for different discharges at the same depth under \nidentical current conditions (Sections 3.1.3.4, 3.1.3.5 and 3.1.3.6). \nThe results show that due to the momentum of the discharge a turbulent mixing zone is created in the \nimmediate vicinity of the discharge point, which is 0 m (Cases C1, C4 and C7), 10 m (Cases C2, C5 and \nC8) and 30 m (Cases C3, C6 and C9) below the water surface. The surface discharges are shown to \nincrease the extent of the turbulent mixing zone. Following this initial mixing, the positively-buoyant plumes \nare predicted to rise in the water column. For the surface discharges, the plume is predicted to plunge up \nto 14 m below the sea surface depending on flow rate and season. For the discharges at depths of 10 m \nand 30 m, the plumes are predicted to plunge up to 25 m and 43 m below the sea surface, respectively, \ndepending on flow rate and season. Increased ambient current strengths are shown to increase the \nhorizontal distance travelled by the plume from the discharge point. \nThe plume characteristics data for each of the discharge flow rates, depths, seasonal conditions and current \nspeeds show that the plume will reach a maximum horizontal distance of between <1 m and 81 m before \nsurfacing, in the case of the surface discharges, or reaching the trapping depth, in the case of the subsea \ndischarges. \nThe diameter of the plume at the end of the near-field zone ranged from <1 m to 17 m. Increases in current \nspeed serve to restrict the diameter of the plume. \nFor most combinations of season, flow rate and discharge depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the \nplume is the strength of the ambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach the \ntrapping depth closer to the discharge point, which slows the rate of dilution. Note that predictions of dilution \nrely on the persistence of current speed and direction over time and do not account for any build-up of plume \nconcentrations due to slack currents or current reversals. \nThe results for each of the discharge flow rates, depths, seasonal conditions and current speeds indicate that \nthe chlorine constituent of the CW discharge is not expected to reach the required levels of dilution in the near \n--- Page 416 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 22 \nfield mixing zone. The temperature differential between the plume and the ambient water meets the required \ncriterion in all conditions for Cases C2, C3, C6 and C9, and in the stronger-current simulations for Cases C1, \nC5 and C8. For Cases C4 and C7, however, compliance with the temperature differential criterion is not \nachieved. Some failures to reach the required threshold concentration and temperature are attributable to the \nplume rapidly breaking the surface. \n \n \n--- Page 417 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 23 \n3.1.2 Results – Tables \n3.1.2.1 Discharge Case C1: Flow Rate of 165,600 m3/day at 0 m Depth (Surface) \n \nPredicted plume characteristics at the end of the near-field mixing zone for the 0 m \ndepth (surface) discharge for each season and current speed. \nSeason \nSurface \nCurrent \nSpeed (m/s) \nPlume \nDiameter (m) \nat Depth [m] \nPlume \nTemperature \n(°C) \nPlume-\nAmbient \nTemperature \nDifference \n(°C) \nPlume Dilution (1:x) \nMaximum \nHorizontal \nDistance (m) \nMinimum \nAverage \nSummer \nWeak (0.04) \n15.2 [6.9] \n34.02 \n6.33 \n1.4 \n2.7 \n0.5 \nMedium (0.16) \n7.6 [1.9] \n30.44 \n2.64 \n2.8 \n6.4 \n5.6 \nStrong (0.33) \n8.4 [3.9] \n29.72 \n1.95 \n2.3 \n8.8 \n10.3 \nTransitional \nWeak (0.05) \n14.4 [6.6] \n33.07 \n3.16 \n1.3 \n2.7 \n0.5 \nMedium (0.18) \n7.5 [2.0] \n28.97 \n2.96 \n2.7 \n6.3 \n5.7 \nStrong (0.38) \n8.0 [3.7] \n28.09 \n2.12 \n2.2 \n9.0 \n10.7 \nWinter \nWeak (0.04) \n14.7 [6.7] \n33.28 \n6.97 \n1.3 \n2.7 \n0.5 \nMedium (0.17) \n7.6 [1.9] \n29.27 \n2.87 \n2.8 \n6.4 \n5.7 \nStrong (0.40) \n7.9 [3.8] \n28.40 \n2.03 \n2.2 \n9.1 \n11.1 \nAnnual \nWeak (0.04) \n14.8 [6.7] \n33.39 \n6.88 \n1.3 \n2.7 \n0.5 \nMedium (0.17) \n7.6 [1.8] \n29.43 \n2.83 \n2.8 \n6.4 \n5.7 \nStrong (0.37) \n8.0 [3.8] \n28.61 \n2.04 \n2.2 \n9.0 \n10.8 \n \nConcentration of chlorine and plume-ambient temperature difference at the end of the \nnear-field stage, the required concentration and temperature threshold, and the \nnumber of dilutions for the summer season.

The far-field results included \nepisodes of pooling of the discharge plume under weak currents, which caused lower dilutions (higher \nconcentrations) further from the discharge location when the pooled plume was advected away. Episodes \nof recirculation – where the plume moved back under the discharge at some later time due to the oscillatory \nnature of the tide – were also observed, compounding the pooling effect and further lowering the dilution \nvalues. \n3.2.2 Interpretation of Percentile Dilution Contours \nFor each of the modelled discharge cases, the results for all simulations were combined and a statistical \nanalysis performed to produce percentile contours of dilution. In the following sections, outcomes based on \n95th and 99th percentile dilution contours are presented. \nCalculation of 95th and 99th percentile statistics is a common approach to assessing the impact of dispersing \nplumes and captures the variability in outcomes, for all but the most ephemeral of forcing conditions, in the \ndata set under consideration. Impact assessment criteria for water quality are often defined using similar \nstatistical indicators. \nNote that the percentile figures do not represent the location of a plume at any point in time; they are a \nstatistical and spatial summary of the percentage of time that particular dilution values occur across all \nreplicate simulations and time steps. For example, if the 95th percentile minimum dilution at a particular \nlocation in the model domain is predicted as a value of 100, this means that for 95% of the time the dilution \nlevel will be higher than 100 and for only 5% of the time the dilution level will be lower than 100. A \ncomparison of the plume extents shown in Figure 3.73 with those shown in Sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 \ndemonstrates the significant difference between an instantaneous snapshot and a cumulative estimate of \ncoverage over several days and many individual simulations. \nDilution contours are calculated from the ratios of dispersing contaminant concentrations in the receiving \nwaters to the initial concentration of the contaminant in the discharge. Note that this assumes the \nbackground concentration of the constituent in the receiving waters is zero and there is no significant \nbiodegradation of the discharged constituent over the short duration of the dispersion process. \nconcentrations required to yield particular dilution levels (1:100, 1:200 and 1:400). These concentrations \nmay be useful to consider when interpreting the contour plots of percentile dilutions. \n \n \n--- Page 517 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 123 \nInitial concentrations of chlorine and equivalent concentrations at example dilution \nlevels. \nChlorine Parameter \nChlorine Concentration (mg/L) \nInitial concentration in discharge \n1,000.0 \nInitial concentration in receiving waters \n0.0 \nConcentration at 1:100 dilution \n10.0 \nConcentration at 1:200 dilution \n5.0 \nConcentration at 1:400 dilution \n1.5 \n \n3.2.3 General Observations \nhour intervals from 18:00 on 25th October 2013 to 10:00 on 26th October 2013. This simulation – selected \nmerely to be representative of typical conditions – considers the Case C1 flow rate of 165,600 m3/d at 0 m \nBMSL. The spatially-varying orientation of the plume with the currents and the rapidly-varying nature of the \nconcentrations around the source can be observed. The snapshots also show the combined effect of the \ntide and the drift currents, with a clear tidal oscillation. \nThese snapshots illustrate that the dilutions (and in turn concentrations) become more variable over time \nbecause of changes in current speed and direction. Higher dilutions (lower concentrations) are predicted \nduring periods of increased current speed, whereas patches of lower dilutions (higher concentrations) tend \nto accumulate during the turning of the tide or during periods of weak drift currents. During prolonged \nperiods of lowered current speed, the plume has a more continuous appearance, with higher-concentration \npatches moving as a unified group. These findings agree with the research of King & McAllister (1997, \n1998) who noted that concentrations within effluent plumes generated by an offshore platform were patchy \nand likely to peak around the reversal of the tides. \n \n \n--- Page 518 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 124 \n \n2013 to 09:00 on 26th October 2013, for Case C1 (0 m depth discharge at 165,600 m3/d \nflow rate). \n \n--- Page 519 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 125 \n3.2.4 Seasonal Analysis \nThe model outputs over the ten-year hindcast period (2006-2015) were combined and analysed on a \nseasonal basis (summer, transitional and winter).

Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 182 \n4 \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe main findings of the study are as follows: \nNear-Field Modelling \n• \nThe results show that due to the momentum of the discharge a turbulent mixing zone is created in the \nimmediate vicinity of the discharge point, which is 0 m (Cases C1, C4 and C7), 10 m (Cases C2, C5 \nand C8) and 30 m (Cases C3, C6 and C9) below the water surface. The surface discharges are shown \nto increase the extent of the turbulent mixing zone. Following this initial mixing, the positively-buoyant \nplumes are predicted to rise in the water column. \n• \nFor Cases C1, C4 and C7 (0 m depth discharge), the plume is predicted to plunge up to 14 m below \nthe sea surface, with the highest flow rate yielding the greatest plunge depth due to the vertical \norientation of the discharges. For the discharges at depths of 10 m and 30 m, the plumes are predicted \nto plunge up to 25 m and 43 m below the sea surface, respectively, with the highest flow rate yielding \nthe greatest plunge depths. \n• \nIncreased ambient current strengths are shown to increase the horizontal distance travelled by the \nplume from the discharge point. \n• \nFor a discharge at a 165,600 m3/d flow rate, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume \nunder annualised average current speeds is predicted for a discharge at 30 m depth as 75.0 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:52. \n• \nFor a discharge at a 64,800 m3/d flow rate, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume \nunder annualised average current speeds is predicted for a discharge at 30 m depth as 69.7 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:77. \n• \nFor a discharge at an 82,800 m3/d flow rate, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume \nunder annualised average current speeds is predicted for a discharge at 30 m depth as 59.8 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:59. \n• \nFor a discharge at 0 m depth, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume under \nannualised average current speeds is predicted for a 165,600 m3/d flow rate discharge as 5.7 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:6. \n• \nFor a discharge at 10 m depth, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume under \nannualised average current speeds is predicted for a 165,600 m3/d flow rate discharge as 11.1 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:17. \n• \nFor a discharge at 30 m depth, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume under \nannualised average current speeds is predicted for a 165,600 m3/d flow rate discharge as 24.5 m. The \ndilution level for this case is predicted as 1:52. \n• \nFor each combination of discharge flow rate and depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the \nplume is the strength of the ambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach \nthe surface (or trapping depth, at which the predictions of dispersion are halted due to the plume reaching \nequilibrium with the ambient receiving water) closer to the discharge point, which slows the rate of \ndilution. \n--- Page 577 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 183 \n• \nThe predictions of dilution rely on the persistence of current speed and direction over time and do not \naccount for any build-up of plume concentrations due to slack currents or current reversals. \n• \nThe results for each combination of discharge flow rate and depth indicate that the chlorine constituent \nof the CW discharge is not expected to reach the required levels of dilution in the near field mixing \nzone. \n• \nThe temperature differential between the plume and the ambient water meets the required criterion in \nall conditions for Cases C2, C3, C6 and C9, and in the stronger-current simulations for Cases C1, C5 \nand C8. For Cases C4 and C7, however, compliance with the temperature differential criterion is not \nachieved. \n• \nSome failures to reach the required threshold concentration and temperature are attributable to the \nplume rapidly breaking the surface. \nFar-Field Modelling \n• \nFor Cases C1 and C3, dilution to reach threshold concentration is achieved for chlorine within an area \nof influence extending up to 1.79 km and 2.47 km, respectively, at the 99th percentile. For Cases C4 \nand C6, the maximum spatial extents of the relevant dilution contour are up to 0.62 km and 0.63 km, \nrespectively, at the 99th percentile. \n• \nFor Cases C1 and C3, the areas of exposure defined by the relevant dilution contour are predicted to \nreach maximums of 4.59 km2 and 6.56 km2, respectively, at the 99th percentile. For Cases C4 and C6, \nthe corresponding maximum areas of exposure are up to 0.40 km2 and 0.68 km2, respectively, at the \n99th percentile. \n• \nMaximum depths reached by. the discharges are predicted as 8 m, 38 m, 6 m and 38 m for Cases C1, \nC3, C4 and C6, respectively. \n• \nBecause the 3 °C plume-ambient temperature differential requirement is forecast to be met within a \ndistance of 115 m at the 99th percentile in any case, the limiting factor for the plume’s area of influence \nwill be defined by its chlorine constituent rather than its temperature. \nKey Observations \n• \nDue to the similarity in typical magnitude of the hindcast currents throughout the depth range of \ndischarges under consideration, predicted outcomes are broadly similar. \n• \nThe greater variability in surface-layer currents may promote the highest levels of mixing and dilution. \n• \nBecause the discharge will be initially positively buoyant, it will rise in the water column and may \nresurface in the vicinity of the discharge point prior to acclimation with ambient receiving water \nconditions. This outcome is particularly likely for the surface discharge. \n• \nOutcomes show that below-threshold chlorine concentrations are achieved closer to the discharge \npoint for a flow rate of 64,800 m3/d than for a higher flow rate of 165,600 m3/d. This is attributable to \nthe fact that initial peak chlorine concentrations in the water column are lower in the former case, which \nreduces the average concentrations likely to be recorded in each model grid cell during episodes of \nrecirculation and pooling. \n \n--- Page 578 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Cooling Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 184 \n5 \nREFERENCES \nto RPS by Advisian, West Perth, WA, Australia. \nAndersen, OB 1995, ‘Global ocean tides from ERS 1 and TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry’, Journal of \nGeophysical Research: Oceans, vol. 100, no.

These will be connected to the mainland through an approximately 430 km \ntrunkline. \nThe Scarborough Project will involve the processing of hydrocarbons which will result in the production of \nproduced water (PW). \nThe principal aim of the study was to quantify the likely extents of the near-field and far-field mixing zones \nbased on the required dilution levels for the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) in the produced water \n(PW) discharge. This will indicate whether concentrations of this contaminant are still likely to be above \nstated threshold levels at the limits of the mixing zones (i.e. are not predicted to be diluted below the relevant \nthreshold). \nTo accurately determine the dilution of the PW discharge and the total potential area of influence, the effect \nof near-field mixing needs to be considered first, followed by an investigation of the far-field mixing \nperformance. Different modelling approaches are required for calculating near-field and far-field dilutions \ndue to the differing hydrodynamic scales. \nTo assess the rate of mixing of the TPH in the PW stream from the FPU, dispersion modelling was carried \nout for a flow rate of 95 m3/d at three discharge depths: 0 m, 10 m and 30 m below the water surface. \nThe potential area that may be influenced by the PW discharge stream was assessed for three distinct \nseasons: (i) summer (December to February); (ii) the transitional periods (March and September to \nNovember); and (iii) winter (April to August). An annualised aggregation of outcomes was also assembled. \nThe main findings of the study are as follows: \nNear-Field Modelling \n• \nThe results show that due to the momentum of the discharge a turbulent mixing zone is created in the \nimmediate vicinity of the discharge point, which is 0 m, 10 m and 30 m below the water surface (Cases \nP1, P2 and P3, respectively). The surface discharges are shown to increase the extent of the turbulent \nmixing zone. Following this initial mixing, the near neutrally-buoyant plumes are predicted to travel \nlaterally in the water column. \n• \nFor Case P1, the plume is predicted to plunge up to 4.4 m below the sea surface. For Cases P2 and \nP3, the plumes are predicted to remain at approximately the discharge depth: up to 11 m below the \nsurface for Case P2 and up to 31 m below the surface for Case P3. \n• \nIncreased ambient current strengths are shown to increase the horizontal distance travelled by the \nplume from the discharge point. \n--- Page 591 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage xi \n• \nFor a discharge at a 95 m3/d flow rate, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume under \nannualised average current speeds is predicted for a discharge at 0 m depth as 255 m. The dilution \nlevel for this case is predicted as 1:1,519. \n• \nThe maximum diameter of the plume at the end of the near-field zone was predicted as 3.7 m for Case \nP1, 1.8 m for Case P2 and 1.7 m for Case P3. Increases in current speed serve to restrict the diameter \nof the plume. \n• \nFor each discharge depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the plume is the strength of the \nambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach the trapping depth (at which \nthe predictions of dispersion are halted due to the plume reaching equilibrium with the ambient receiving \nwater) closer to the discharge point, which slows the rate of dilution. \n• \nThe average dilution levels of the plume upon reaching the trapping depth under average current speeds \nare predicted to be 1:1,519 for Case P1, 1:88 for Case P2 and 1:43 for Case P3. Additionally, the \nminimum dilution levels of the plume (i.e. dilution of the plume centreline) upon encountering the trapping \ndepth under average current speeds are predicted to be 1:390 for Case P1, 1:22 for Case P2 and 1:11 \nfor Case P3. \n• \nThe predictions of dilution rely on the persistence of current speed and direction over time and do not \naccount for any build-up of plume concentrations due to slack currents or current reversals. \n• \nThe results for the Case P1, P2 and P3 discharges indicate that the TPH constituent of the PW \ndischarge is not expected to reach the required levels of dilution in the near field mixing zone. \nFar-Field Modelling \n• \nFor Case P1, dilution to reach threshold concentration is achieved for TPH within an area of influence \nextending up to 543 m at the 99th percentile. For Case P3, the maximum spatial extents of the relevant \ndilution contour are up to 810 m at the 99th percentile. \n• \nFor Case P1, the area of exposure defined by the relevant dilution contour is predicted to reach a \nmaximum of 0.48 km2 at the 99th percentile. For Case P3, the corresponding maximum area of \nexposure is up to 0.70 km2 at the 99th percentile. \n• \nMaximum depths reached by the discharges are predicted as 5 m and 33 m for Cases P1 and P3, \nrespectively. \nKey Observations \n• \nDue to the similarity in typical magnitude of the hindcast currents throughout the depth range of \ndischarges under consideration, predicted outcomes are broadly similar. \n• \nThe greater variability in surface-layer currents will promote the highest levels of mixing and dilution. \n• \nBecause the discharge will be initially negatively buoyant, it will sink in the water column and even a \nsurface discharge is unlikely to resurface in the vicinity of the discharge point prior to acclimation with \nambient receiving water conditions. \n \n--- Page 592 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 1 \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \n1.1 \nBackground \nRPS was commissioned by Advisian Pty Ltd (Advisian), on behalf of Woodside Energy Ltd (Woodside), to \nundertake a marine dispersion modelling study of proposed water discharges from the Scarborough \nProject’s Floating Production Unit (FPU). \nThe Scarborough gas resource, located in Commonwealth waters approximately 375 km off the Burrup \nPeninsula, forms part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, comprising the Scarborough, North \nScarborough, Thebe and Jupiter gas fields. \nAs Operator of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, Woodside is proposing to develop the gas resource \nthrough new offshore facilities. These will be connected to the mainland through an approximately 430 km \ntrunkline. \nThe Scarborough Project will involve the processing of hydrocarbons which will result in the production of \nproduced water (PW). \nThe principal aim of the study was to quantify the likely extents of the near-field and far-field mixing zones \nbased on the required dilution levels for the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) in the produced water \n(PW) discharge. This will indicate whether concentrations of this contaminant are still likely to be above \nstated threshold levels at the limits of the mixing zones (i.e. are not predicted to be diluted below the relevant \nthreshold). \nTo accurately determine the dilution of the PW discharge and the total potential area of influence, the effect \nof near-field mixing needs to be considered first, followed by an investigation of the far-field mixing \nperformance. Different modelling approaches are required for calculating near-field and far-field dilutions \ndue to the differing hydrodynamic scales. \nTo assess the rate of mixing of the TPH in the PW stream from the FPU (location shown in Table 1.1), \ndispersion modelling was carried out for a flow rate of 95 m3/d at three discharge depths: 0 m, 10 m and \n30 m below the water surface. \nThe potential area that may be influenced by the PW discharge stream was assessed for three distinct \nseasons: (i) summer (December to February); (ii) the transitional periods (March and September to \nNovember); and (iii) winter (April to August).

The limits of the \nnear-field mixing zone are defined by the area where the levels of mixing and dilution are controlled by the \nplume’s initial jet momentum and the buoyancy flux, resulting from density differences between the plume \nand the receiving water. When the plume encounters a boundary such as the water surface, near-field \nmixing is complete. At this point, the plume is considered to enter the far-field mixing zone. \nThe scope of the modelling included the following components: \n• \nCollation of a suitable three-dimensional, spatially-varying current data set surrounding the FPU \nlocation for a ten-year (2006-2015) hindcast period. The current data set included the combined \ninfluence of drift and tidal currents and was suitably long as to be indicative of interannual variability in \nocean currents. The current data set was validated against metocean data collected in the \nScarborough Project area. \n• \nDerivation of statistical distributions for the current speed and directions for use in the near-field \nmodelling. Analyses included percentile distributions and development of current roses. This analysis \nwas important to ensure that current data samples applied in the dispersion model were statistically \nrepresentative. \n• \nCollation of seasonally-varying vertical water density profiles at the FPU location for use as input to \nthe dispersion models. \n• \nNear-field modelling conducted for each unique discharge to assess the initial mixing of the discharge \ndue to turbulence and subsequent entrainment of ambient water. This modelling was conducted at \nhigh spatial and temporal resolution (scales of metres and seconds, respectively). \n• \nOutcomes from the near-field modelling included estimates of the width, shape and orientation of the \nplumes, and resulting contaminant concentrations and dilutions, for each discharge at a range of \nincident current speeds. \n• \nEstablishment of a far-field dispersion model to repeatedly assess discharge scenarios under different \nsample conditions, with each sample represented by a unique time-sequence of current flow, chosen \nat random from the time series of current data. \n• \nAnalysis of the results of all simulations to quantify, by return frequency, the potential extent and shape \nof the mixing zone. \n--- Page 595 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 4 \n2 \nMODELLING METHODS \n2.1 \nNear-Field Modelling \n2.1.1 Overview \nNumerical modelling was applied to quantify the area of influence of PW water discharges, in terms of the \ndistribution of the maximum contaminant concentrations that might occur with distance from the source \ngiven defined discharge configurations, source concentrations, and the distribution of the metocean \nconditions affecting the discharge location. \nThe dispersion of the PW discharge will depend, initially, on the geometry and hydrodynamics of the \ndischarges themselves, where the induced momentum and buoyancy effects dominate over background \nprocesses. This region is generally referred to as the near-field zone and is characterised by variations over \nshort time and space scales. As the discharges mix with the ambient waters, the momentum and buoyancy \nsignatures are eroded, and the background – or ambient – processes become dominant. \nThe shape and orientation of the discharged water plumes, and hence the distribution and dilution rate of \nthe plume, will vary significantly with natural variation in prevailing water currents. Therefore, to best \ncalculate the likely outcomes of the discharges, it is necessary to simulate discharge under a statistically \nrepresentative range of current speeds representative of the FPU location. \n2.1.2 Description of Near-Field Model: Updated Merge \nThe near-field mixing and dispersion of the water discharge was simulated using the Updated Merge (UM3) \nflow model. The UM3 model is a three-dimensional Lagrangian steady-state plume trajectory model \ndesigned for simulating single and multiple-port submerged discharges in a range of configurations, \navailable within the Visual Plumes modelling package provided by the United States Environmental \nProtection Agency (Frick et al., 2003). The UM3 model was selected because it has been extensively tested \nfor various discharges and found to predict observed dilutions more accurately (Roberts & Tian, 2004) than \nother near-field models (i.e. RSB and CORMIX). \nIn the UM3 model, the equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are solved at each time \nstep, giving the dilution along the plume trajectory. To determine the change of each term, UM3 follows the \nshear (or Taylor) entrainment hypothesis and the projected-area-entrainment (PAE) hypothesis, which \nquantifies forced entrainment in the presence of a background ocean current. The flows begin as round \nbuoyant jets and can merge to a plane buoyant jet (Carvalho et al., 2002). Model output consists of plume \ncharacteristics including centreline dilution, rise-rate, width, centreline height and plume diameter. Dilution \nis reported as the “effective dilution”, the ratio of the initial concentration to the concentration of the plume \nat a given point, following Baumgartner et al. (1994). \nThe near-field zone ends where the discharged plume reaches a physical boundary or assumes the same \ndensity as the ambient water. \nthe idealised representation of the discharge phases. \n \n \n--- Page 596 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 5 \n \nConceptual diagram showing the general behaviour of negatively buoyant discharge. \n \n2.1.3 Setup of Near-Field Model \n2.1.3.1 Discharge Characteristics \nThe PW discharge characteristics for Cases P1 to P3 are summarised in Table 2.1.

In \nthis case, concentrations near the discharge point can be increased due to the discharge plume mixing with \nthe remnant plume from an earlier time. This may be a potential source of episodic increases in pollutant \nconcentrations in the receiving waters. \n2.2.2 Description of Far-Field Model: MUDMAP \nThe mixing and dispersion of the discharges was predicted using the three-dimensional discharge and \nplume behaviour model, MUDMAP (Koh & Chang, 1973; Khondaker, 2000). \nThe far-field calculation (passive dispersion stage) employs a particle-based, random walk procedure. Any \nchemicals/constituents within the discharge stream are represented by a sample of Lagrangian particles. \nThese particles are moved in three dimensions over each subsequent time step according to the prevailing \nlocal current data as well as horizontal and vertical mixing coefficients. \nMUDMAP treats the Lagrangian particles as conservative tracers (i.e. they are not removed over time to \naccount for chemical interactions, decay or precipitation). Predicted concentrations will therefore be \nconservative overestimates where these processes actually do occur. Each particle represents a proportion \nof the discharge, by mass, and particles are released at a given rate to represent the rate of the discharge \n(mass per unit time). Concentrations of constituents are predicted over time by counting the number of \nparticles that occur within a given depth level and grid square and converting this value to mass per unit \nvolume. \n--- Page 600 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 9 \nThe system has been extensively validated and applied for discharge operations in Australian waters (e.g. \nBurns et al., 1999; King & McAllister, 1997, 1998). \n2.2.3 Stochastic Modelling \nA stochastic modelling procedure was applied in the far-field modelling to sample a representative set of \nconditions that could affect the distribution of constituents. This approach involves multiple (25) simulations \nof a given discharge scenario and season, with each simulation being carried out under a randomly-\nselected period of currents. This methodology ensures that the calculated movement and fate of each \ndischarge is representative of the range of prevailing currents at the discharge location. Once the stochastic \nmodelling is complete, all simulations are statistically analysed to develop the distribution of outcomes \nbased on time and event. \n2.2.4 Setup of Far-Field Model \n2.2.4.1 Discharge Characteristics \nThe MUDMAP model simulated the discharge into a time-varying current field with the initial dilution set by \nthe near-field results described in Section 2.1. \nTwo PW discharge scenarios were modelled as a continuous discharge using 25 simulations for each \nseason. Once the simulations were complete, they were reported on a seasonal basis: (i) summer \n(December to February); (ii) transitional (March and September to November) and (iii) winter (April to \nAugust). The PW discharge characteristics for the selected cases (P1 and P3) are summarised in Table \n2.5.

Both coefficients are expressed in units of rate of area change \nper second (m2/s). Increasing the horizontal dispersion coefficient will increase the horizontal spread of the \ndischarge plume and decrease the centreline concentrations faster. Increasing the vertical dispersion \ncoefficient spreads the discharge across the vertical layers (or depths) faster. \nSpatially constant, conservative dispersion coefficients of 0.15 m2/s and 0.00005 m2/s were used to control \nthe spreading of the PW plume in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Each of the mixing \nparameters was selected following extensive sensitivity testing to recreate the plume characteristics \npredicted by the near-field modelling. It would be expected that the in-situ mixing dynamics would be greater \nunder average and high energy conditions by a factor of 10 (King & McAllister, 1997, 1998) and thus the \nfar-field model results are designed to produce a worst-case result for concentration extents. \n2.2.4.3 Grid Configuration \nMUDMAP uses a three-dimensional grid to represent the geographic region under study (water depth and \nbathymetric profiles). Due to the rapid mixing and small-scale effect of the effluent discharge, it was \nnecessary to use a fine grid with a resolution of 5 m x 5 m to track the movement and fate of the discharge \nplume. The extent of the grid region measured approximately 5 km (longitude or x-axis) by 5 km (latitude \nor y-axis), which was subdivided horizontally into 1,000 x 1,000 cells. The vertical resolution was set to 1 m. \n2.2.5 Regional Ocean Currents \n2.2.5.1 Background \nThe area of interest for this study is typified by strong tidal flows over the shallower regions, particularly \nalong the inshore region of the North West Shelf and among the island groups stretching from the Dampier \nArchipelago to the North West Cape. However, the offshore regions with water depths exceeding 100-\n200 m experience significant large-scale drift currents. These drift currents can be relatively strong (1-2 \nknots) and complex, manifesting as a series of eddies, meandering currents and connecting flows. These \noffshore drift currents also tend to persist longer (days to weeks) than tidal current flows (hours between \nreversals) and thus will have greater influence upon the net trajectory of slicks over time scales exceeding \na few hours. \nWind shear on the water surface also generates local-scale currents that can persist for extended periods \n(hours to days) and result in long trajectories. Hence, the current-induced transport of pollutants can be \nvariably affected by combinations of tidal, wind-induced and density-induced drift currents. Depending on \ntheir local influence, it is critical to consider all these potential advective mechanisms to rigorously \nunderstand patterns of potential transport from a given discharge location. \nTo appropriately allow for temporal and spatial variation in the current field, dispersion modelling requires \nthe current speed and direction over a spatial grid covering the potential migration of pollutants. As \nmeasured current data is not available for simultaneous periods over a network of locations covering the \nwide area of this study, the analysis relied upon hindcasts of the circulation generated by numerical \nmodelling. Estimates of the net currents were derived by combining predictions of the drift currents, \navailable from mesoscale ocean models, with estimates of the tidal currents generated by an RPS model \nset up for the study area. \n--- Page 602 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 11 \n2.2.5.2 Mesoscale Circulation Model \nRepresentation of the drift currents that affect the area were available from the output of the BRAN (Bluelink \nReANalysis; Oke et al., 2008, 2009; Schiller et al., 2008) ocean model, which is sponsored by the Australian \nGovernment through the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), Royal Australian Navy, and \nCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). BRAN is a data-assimilative, \nthree-dimensional ocean model that has been run as a hindcast for many periods and is now used for \nocean forecasting (Schiller et al., 2008). \nThe BRAN predictions for drift currents are produced at a horizontal spatial resolution of approximately 0.1° \nover the region, at a frequency of once per day, averaged over the 24-hour period. Hence, the BRAN model \ndata provides estimates of mesoscale circulation with horizontal resolution suitable to resolve eddies of a \nfew tens of kilometres’ diameter, as well as connecting stream currents of similar spatial scale. Drift currents \nthat are represented over the inner shelf waters in the BRAN data are principally attributable to wind induced \ndrift. \nThere are several versions of the BRAN database available. The latest BRAN simulation spans the period \nof January 1994 to August 2016. From this database, time series of current speed and direction were \nextracted for all points in the model domain for the years 2006-2015 (inclusive). The data was assumed to \nbe a suitably representative sample of the current conditions over the study area for future years. \nto the FPU location.

In general, during transitional \nmonths (March and September to November) currents have the strongest average speed (0.22 m/s with a \nmaximum of 0.56 m/s) and tend to flow south-east.

The colour key shows the current magnitude, the \ncompass direction provides the direction towards which the current is flowing, and the \nsize of the wedge gives the percentage of the record. \n \n2.2.5.3 Tidal Circulation Model \nAs the BRAN model does not include tidal forcing, and because the data is only available at a daily \nfrequency, a tidal model was developed for the study region using RPS’ three-dimensional hydrodynamic \nmodel, HYDROMAP. \nThe model formulations and output (current speed, direction and sea level) of this model have been \nvalidated through field measurements around the world for more than 25 years (Isaji & Spaulding, 1984, \n1986; Isaji et al., 2001; Zigic et al., 2003). HYDROMAP current data has also been widely used as input to \nforecasts and hindcasts of oil spill migrations in Australian waters. This modelling system forms part of the \nNational Marine Oil Spill Contingency Plan for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA, 2002). \nHYDROMAP simulates the flow of ocean currents within a model region due to forcing by astronomical \ntides, wind stress and bottom friction. The model employs a sophisticated dynamically nested-gridding \nstrategy, supporting up to six levels of spatial resolution within a single domain. This allows for higher \nresolution of currents within areas of greater bathymetric and coastline complexity, or of particular interest \nto a study. \nThe numerical solution methodology of HYDROMAP follows that of Davies (1977a, 1977b) with further \ndevelopments for model efficiency by Owen (1980) and Gordon (1982). A more detailed presentation of \nthe model can be found in Isaji & Spaulding (1984). \nA HYDROMAP model was established over a domain that extended approximately 3,300 km east-west by \n3,100 km north-south over the eastern Indian Ocean. The grid extends beyond Eucla in the south and \nbeyond Bathurst Island in the north (Figure 2.3). \nFour layers of sub-gridding were applied to provide variable resolution throughout the domain. The \nresolution at the primary level was 15 km. The finer levels were defined by subdividing these cells into 4, \n--- Page 604 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 13 \n16 and 64 cells, resulting in resolutions of 7.5 km, 3.75 km and 1.88 km. The finer grids were allocated in \na step-wise fashion to areas where higher resolution of circulation patterns was required to resolve flows \nthrough channels, around shorelines or over more complex bathymetry. Approximately 98,600 cells were \nused to define the region. \nBathymetric data used to define the three-dimensional shape of the study domain was extracted from the \nCMAP electronic chart database and supplemented where necessary with manual digitisation of chart data \nsupplied by the Australian Hydrographic Office. Depths in the domain ranged from shallow intertidal areas \nthrough to approximately 7,200 m. \nOcean boundary data for the HYDROMAP model was obtained from the TOPEX/Poseidon global tidal \ndatabase (TPXO7.2) of satellite-measured altimetry data, which provided estimates of tidal amplitudes and \nphases for the eight dominant tidal constituents (designated as K2, S2, M2, N2, K1, P1, O1 and Q1) at a \nhorizontal scale of approximately 0.25°. Using the tidal data, sea surface heights are firstly calculated along \nthe open boundaries at each time step in the model. \nThe TOPEX/Poseidon satellite data is produced, and quality controlled by the US National Atmospheric \nand Space Agency (NASA). The satellites, equipped with two highly accurate altimeters capable of taking \nsea level measurements accurate to less than ±5 cm, measured oceanic surface elevations (and the \nresultant tides) for over 13 years (1992-2005). In total, these satellites carried out more than 62,000 orbits \nof the planet. The TOPEX/Poseidon tidal data has been widely used amongst the oceanographic \ncommunity, being the subject of more than 2,100 research publications (e.g. Andersen, 1995; Ludicone et \nal., 1998; Matsumoto et al., 2000; Kostianoy et al., 2003; Yaremchuk & Tangdong, 2004; Qiu & Chen, \n2010). As such, the TOPEX/Poseidon tidal data is considered suitably accurate for this study. \nFor the purpose of verification of the tidal predictions, the model output was compared against independent \npredictions of tides using the XTide database (Flater, 1998). The XTide database contains harmonic tidal \nconstituents derived from measured water level data at locations around the world. Of more than 40 tidal \nstations within the HYDROMAP model domain, ten were used for comparison. \nWater level time series for these locations are shown in Figure 2.4 for a one-month period (January 2005). \nAll comparisons show that the model produces a very good match to the known tidal behaviour for a wide \nrange of tidal amplitudes and clearly represents the varying diurnal and semi-diurnal nature of the tidal \nsignal. \nThe model skill was further evaluated through a comparison of the predicted and observed tidal \nconstituents, derived from an analysis of model-predicted time-series at each location. A scatter plot of the \nobserved and modelled amplitude (top) and phase (bottom) of the five dominant tidal constituents (S2, M2, \nN2, K1 and O1) is presented in Figure 2.5. The red line on each plot shows the 1:1 line, which would indicate \na perfect match between the modelled and observed data. Note that the data is generally closely aligned \nto the 1:1 line demonstrating the high quality of the model performance. \nclosest to the FPU location. Note that the convention for defining current direction is the direction towards \nwhich the current flows. \nThe current data indicates cyclical tidal flow directions along a northeast-southwest axis, with maximum \nspeeds of around 0.09 m/s. \n--- Page 605 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 14 \n \nHydrodynamic model grid (grey wire mesh) used to generate the tidal currents, \nshowing locations available for tidal comparisons (red labelled dots).

Any dilution \nrates indicated in red show that suitable dilution is not achieved during the near-field stage for at least one \ncurrent-speed case. \ndilution and temperature of the plume under varying discharge depths (0 m, 10 m and 30 m), seasonal \nconditions (summer, transitional, winter and annual) and current speeds (weak, medium and strong). The \nfigures show the predicted horizontal distances travelled by the plume before the trapping depth is reached \n(i.e. before the plume becomes neutrally buoyant). \nIn each figure, the plots have been arranged to demonstrate the variation in predicted outcomes for the same \ndischarge at different depths under identical current conditions. \nThe results show that due to the momentum of the discharge a turbulent mixing zone is created in the \nimmediate vicinity of the discharge point, which is 0 m, 10 m and 30 m below the water surface (Cases P1, \nP2 and P3, respectively). The surface discharges are shown to increase the extent of the turbulent mixing \nzone. Following this initial mixing, the near neutrally-buoyant plumes are predicted to travel laterally in the \nwater column. For Case P1, the plume is predicted to plunge between 0.1 m and 4.4 m below the sea surface \ndepending on season. For Cases P2 and P3, the plumes are predicted to remain at approximately the \ndischarge depth: 9-11 m below the surface for Case P2 and 29-31 m below the surface for Case P3, \ndepending on season. Increased ambient current strengths are shown to increase the horizontal distance \ntravelled by the plume from the discharge point. \ndepths, seasonal conditions and current speeds. High annualised currents push the plume to maximum \nhorizontal distances of 866 m and 123 m for the Case P1 and Case P3 discharges, respectively. \nThe diameter of the plume at the end of the near-field zone ranged from 0.4 m to 3.7 m for Case P1, 0.5 m to \n1.8 m for Case P2 and 0.6 m to 1.7 m for Case P3. Increases in current speed serve to restrict the diameter \nof the plume. \nFor most combinations of season and discharge depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the plume is \nthe strength of the ambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach the trapping \ndepth closer to the discharge point, which slows the rate of dilution (Table 3.1, Table 3.6 and Table 3.11). \nThe average dilution levels of the plume upon reaching the trapping depth under medium and strong currents \nare predicted to be 1:1,519 and 1:3,616 for Case P1, 1:88 and 1:140 for Case P2, and 1:43 and 1:181 for \nCase P3, respectively. Additionally, the minimum dilution levels of the plume (i.e. dilution of the plume \ncentreline) upon encountering the trapping depth under medium and strong currents are predicted to be 1:390 \nand 1:929 for Case P1, 1:22 and 1:36 for Case P2, and 1:11 and 1:46 for Case P3. Note that these predictions \n--- Page 610 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 19 \nrely on the persistence of current speed and direction over time and do not account for any build-up of plume \nconcentrations due to slack currents or current reversals. \nThe results for the Case P1 (Section 3.1.2; Table 3.2 to Table 3.5), Case P2 (Section 3.1.2.2; Table 3.7 to \nconstituent of the PW discharge is not expected to reach the required levels of dilution in the near field mixing \nzone. \n \n \n--- Page 611 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 20 \n3.1.2 Results – Tables \n3.1.2.1 Discharge Case P1: Flow Rate of 95 m3/day at 0 m Depth (Surface) \n \nPredicted plume characteristics at the end of the near-field mixing zone for the 0 m \ndepth (surface) discharge for each season and current speed. \nSeason \nSurface \nCurrent \nSpeed (m/s) \nPlume \nDiameter (m) \nat Depth [m] \nPlume \nTemperature \n(°C) \nPlume-\nAmbient \nTemperature \nDifference \n(°C) \nPlume Dilution (1:x) \nMaximum \nHorizontal \nDistance (m) \nMinimum \nAverage \nSummer \nWeak (0.04) \n3.5 [2.7] \n27.83 \n0.03 \n91 \n351 \n16.8 \nMedium (0.16) \n3.4 [2.6] \n27.81 \n0.01 \n339 \n1,321 \n124.1 \nStrong (0.33) \n3.5 [2.6] \n27.80 \n0.00 \n725 \n2,821 \n376.9 \nTransitional \nWeak (0.05) \n0.3 [0.2] \n32.84 \n6.84 \n1 \n2 \n0.9 \nMedium (0.18) \n0.4 [0.2] \n26.91 \n0.91 \n4 \n15 \n4.2 \nStrong (0.38) \n0.3 [0.2] \n26.47 \n0.47 \n7 \n30 \n7.9 \nWinter \nWeak (0.04) \n0.4 [0.2] \n31.03 \n4.63 \n1 \n3 \n0.4 \nMedium (0.17) \n3.6 [2.6] \n26.41 \n0.01 \n412 \n1,601 \n325.7 \nStrong (0.40) \n0.4 [0.2] \n26.74 \n0.34 \n10 \n40 \n11.8 \nAnnual \nWeak (0.04) \n0.4 [0.2] \n29.83 \n3.23 \n1 \n4 \n0.8 \nMedium (0.17) \n3.5 [2.6] \n26.61 \n0.01 \n390 \n1,519 \n255.0 \nStrong (0.37) \n3.7 [2.6] \n26.60 \n0.00 \n929 \n3,613 \n866.3 \n \nConcentration of TPH at the end of the near-field stage, and the required concentration \nthreshold and number of dilutions for the summer season.

The far-field results included \nepisodes of pooling of the discharge plume under weak currents, which caused lower dilutions (higher \nconcentrations) further from the discharge location when the pooled plume was advected away. Episodes \nof recirculation – where the plume moved back under the discharge at some later time due to the oscillatory \nnature of the tide – were also observed, compounding the pooling effect and further lowering the dilution \nvalues. \n3.2.2 Interpretation of Percentile Dilution Contours \nFor each of the modelled discharge cases, the results for all simulations were combined and a statistical \nanalysis performed to produce percentile contours of dilution. In the following sections, outcomes based on \n95th and 99th percentile dilution contours are presented. \nCalculation of 95th and 99th percentile statistics is a common approach to assessing the impact of dispersing \nplumes and captures the variability in outcomes, for all but the most ephemeral and extreme forcing \nconditions, in the data set under consideration. Impact assessment criteria for water quality are often \ndefined using similar statistical indicators. \nNote that the percentile figures do not represent the location of a plume at any point in time; they are a \nstatistical and spatial summary of the percentage of time that particular dilution values occur across all \nreplicate simulations and time steps. For example, if the 95th percentile minimum dilution at a particular \nlocation in the model domain is predicted as a value of 100, this means that for 95% of the time the dilution \nlevel will be higher than 100 and for only 5% of the time the dilution level will be lower than 100. A \ncomparison of the plume extents shown in Figure 3.13 with those shown in Sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 \ndemonstrates the significant difference between an instantaneous snapshot and a cumulative estimate of \ncoverage over several days and many individual simulations. \nDilution contours are calculated from the ratios of dispersing contaminant concentrations in the receiving \nwaters to the initial concentration of the contaminant in the discharge. Note that this assumes the \nbackground concentration of the constituent in the receiving waters is zero and there is no significant \nbiodegradation of the discharged constituent over the short duration of the dispersion process. \nconcentrations required to yield particular dilution levels (1:100, 1:200 and 1:400). These concentrations \nmay be useful to consider when interpreting the contour plots of percentile dilutions. \n \n \n--- Page 630 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 39 \nInitial concentrations of TPH and equivalent concentrations at example dilution levels. \nTPH Parameter \nTPH Concentration (mg/L) \nInitial concentration in discharge \n29.0 \nInitial concentration in receiving waters \n0.0 \nConcentration at 1:100 dilution \n0.29 \nConcentration at 1:200 dilution \n0.145 \nConcentration at 1:400 dilution \n0.0725 \n \n3.2.3 General Observations \nhour intervals from 10:00 on 29th December 2008 to 01:00 on 30th December 2008. This simulation – \nselected merely to be representative of typical conditions – considers the Case P1 discharge at 0 m BMSL. \nThe spatially-varying orientation of the plume with the currents and the rapidly-varying nature of the \nconcentrations around the source can be observed. The snapshots also show the combined effect of the \ntide and the drift currents, with a clear tidal oscillation. \nThese snapshots illustrate that the dilutions (and in turn concentrations) become more variable over time \nbecause of changes in current speed and direction. Higher dilutions (lower concentrations) are predicted \nduring periods of increased current speed, whereas patches of lower dilutions (higher concentrations) tend \nto accumulate during the turning of the tide or during periods of weak drift currents. During prolonged \nperiods of lowered current speed, the plume has a more continuous appearance, with higher-concentration \npatches moving as a unified group. These findings agree with the research of King & McAllister (1997, \n1998) who noted that concentrations within effluent plumes generated by an offshore platform were patchy \nand likely to peak around the reversal of the tides. \n \n \n--- Page 631 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 40 \n \n2008 to 01:00 on 30th December 2008, for Case P1 (0 m depth discharge at 95 m3/d flow \nrate). \n \n--- Page 632 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 41 \n3.2.4 Seasonal Analysis \nThe model outputs over the ten-year hindcast period (2006-2015) were combined and analysed on a \nseasonal basis (summer, transitional and winter).

The results \nindicate that the release of effluent under all seasonal conditions results in rapid dispersion within the \nambient environment. For Case P1, dilution to reach threshold concentration is achieved for TPH within an \narea of influence ranging from 181 m to 221 m at the 95th percentile across all seasons (Table 3.19). For \nCase P3, the maximum spatial extents of the relevant dilution contour vary from 184 m to 229 m at the 95th \npercentile across all seasons (Table 3.20). The greatest spatial extents are observed in winter. \ncoverage for the 1:414 dilution contour for each season and percentile. For Case P1, the area of exposure \ndefined by the relevant dilution contour is predicted to reach maximums of 0.03 km2 to 0.04 km2 at the 95th \npercentile (Table 3.21).

The surface discharges are shown to increase the extent of the turbulent \nmixing zone. Following this initial mixing, the near neutrally-buoyant plumes are predicted to travel \nlaterally in the water column. \n• \nFor Case P1, the plume is predicted to plunge up to 4.4 m below the sea surface. For Cases P2 and \nP3, the plumes are predicted to remain at approximately the discharge depth: up to 11 m below the \nsurface for Case P2 and up to 31 m below the surface for Case P3. \n• \nIncreased ambient current strengths are shown to increase the horizontal distance travelled by the \nplume from the discharge point. \n• \nFor a discharge at a 95 m3/d flow rate, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the plume under \nannualised average current speeds is predicted for a discharge at 0 m depth as 255 m. The dilution \nlevel for this case is predicted as 1:1,519. \n• \nThe maximum diameter of the plume at the end of the near-field zone was predicted as 3.7 m for Case \nP1, 1.8 m for Case P2 and 1.7 m for Case P3. Increases in current speed serve to restrict the diameter \nof the plume. \n• \nFor each discharge depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the plume is the strength of the \nambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach the trapping depth (at which \nthe predictions of dispersion are halted due to the plume reaching equilibrium with the ambient receiving \nwater) closer to the discharge point, which slows the rate of dilution. \n• \nThe average dilution levels of the plume upon reaching the trapping depth under average current speeds \nare predicted to be 1:1,519 for Case P1, 1:88 for Case P2 and 1:43 for Case P3. Additionally, the \nminimum dilution levels of the plume (i.e. dilution of the plume centreline) upon encountering the trapping \ndepth under average current speeds are predicted to be 1:390 for Case P1, 1:22 for Case P2 and 1:11 \nfor Case P3. \n• \nThe predictions of dilution rely on the persistence of current speed and direction over time and do not \naccount for any build-up of plume concentrations due to slack currents or current reversals. \n• \nThe results for the Case P1, P2 and P3 discharges indicate that the TPH constituent of the PW \ndischarge is not expected to reach the required levels of dilution in the near field mixing zone. \nFar-Field Modelling \n• \nFor Case P1, dilution to reach threshold concentration is achieved for TPH within an area of influence \nextending up to 543 m at the 99th percentile. For Case P3, the maximum spatial extents of the relevant \ndilution contour are up to 810 m at the 99th percentile. \n--- Page 657 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 66 \n• \nFor Case P1, the area of exposure defined by the relevant dilution contour is predicted to reach a \nmaximum of 0.48 km2 at the 99th percentile. For Case P3, the corresponding maximum area of \nexposure is up to 0.70 km2 at the 99th percentile. \n• \nMaximum depths reached by the discharges are predicted as 5 m and 33 m for Cases P1 and P3, \nrespectively. \nKey Observations \n• \nDue to the similarity in typical magnitude of the hindcast currents throughout the depth range of \ndischarges under consideration, predicted outcomes are broadly similar. \n• \nThe greater variability in surface-layer currents will promote the highest levels of mixing and dilution. \n• \nBecause the discharge will be initially negatively buoyant, it will sink in the water column and even a \nsurface discharge is unlikely to resurface in the vicinity of the discharge point prior to acclimation with \nambient receiving water conditions. \n \n--- Page 658 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Produced Water Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 67 \n5 \nREFERENCES \nto RPS by Advisian, West Perth, WA, Australia. \nAndersen, OB 1995, ‘Global ocean tides from ERS 1 and TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry’, Journal of \nGeophysical Research: Oceans, vol. 100, no.

to \nundertake a marine dispersion modelling study of proposed hydrotest discharges from subsea \ninfrastructure associated with the Scarborough Project’s Floating Production Unit (FPU). \nThe Scarborough gas resource, located in Commonwealth waters approximately 375 km off the Burrup \nPeninsula, forms part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, comprising the Scarborough, North \nScarborough, Thebe and Jupiter gas fields. \nAs Operator of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, Woodside is proposing to develop the gas resource \nthrough new offshore facilities. These will be connected to the mainland through an approximately 430 km \ntrunkline. \nOnce installation and hook-up of subsea infrastructure is complete, the infrastructure, including the SURF \n(subsea, umbilical, riser, flowline) and the trunkline, will be subject to pre-commissioning integrity tests. \nThese may be conducted using hydrotest fluids, whereby the pipeline pressure will be monitored to detect \nleaks. Fluids will then be left in place to provide corrosion protection prior to the introduction of reservoir \nfluids, at which time they will be discharged at the offshore location (subject to regulatory requirements). \nThe principal aim of the study was to quantify the likely extents of the near-field and far-field mixing zones \nbased on the required dilution levels for biocide in the hydrotest discharge. This will indicate whether \nconcentrations of this contaminant are still likely to be above stated threshold levels at the limits of the \nmixing zones (i.e. are not predicted to be diluted below the relevant threshold). \nTo accurately determine the dilution of the hydrotest discharge and the total potential area of influence, the \neffect of near-field mixing needs to be considered first, followed by an investigation of the far-field mixing \nperformance. Different modelling approaches are required for calculating near-field and far-field dilutions \ndue to the differing hydrodynamic scales. \nTo assess the rate of mixing of the biocide in the hydrotest stream from the trunkline and SURF, dispersion \nmodelling was carried out for flow rates of 795 m3/hr and 220 m3/hr at discharge depths of 930 m and 10 m \nbelow the water surface. \nThe potential area that may be influenced by the hydrotest discharge stream was assessed for three distinct \nseasons: (i) summer (December to February); (ii) the transitional periods (March and September to \nNovember); and (iii) winter (April to August). An annualised aggregation of outcomes was also assembled. \nThe main findings of the study are as follows: \nNear-Field Modelling \n• \nThe results show that due to the momentum of the discharge a turbulent mixing zone is created in the \nimmediate vicinity of the discharge point, which is 930 m (Cases 1 and 2) and 10 m (Case 3) below the \nwater surface. The surface discharges are shown to increase the extent of the turbulent mixing zone. \nFollowing this initial mixing, the near neutrally-buoyant plumes are predicted to travel laterally in the water \ncolumn. \n• \nFor Cases 1 and 2, the plumes are predicted to remain close to the seabed. For Case 3, the plume is \npredicted to plunge up to 19 m below the sea surface. For Cases 2 and 3, increased ambient current \nstrengths are shown to increase the horizontal distance travelled by the plumes from the discharge point. \n--- Page 671 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage xi \n• \nThe plume will reach a maximum horizontal distance of up to 152 m before reaching the trapping depth \n(at which the predictions of dispersion are halted due to the plume reaching equilibrium with the ambient \nreceiving water). \n• \nThe maximum diameter of the plume at the end of the near-field zone was predicted as 23 m. Increases \nin current speed serve to restrict the diameter of the plume. \n• \nFor each discharge depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the plume is the strength of the \nambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach the trapping depth closer to \nthe discharge point, which slows the rate of dilution. \n• \nFor each combination of discharge flow rate and depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the \nplume is the strength of the ambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach \nthe trapping depth closer to the discharge point, which slows the rate of dilution. \n• \nThe average dilution levels of the plume upon reaching the trapping depth under average current speeds \nare predicted to be 1:90 for Case 1, 1:465 for Case 2 and 1:482 for Case 3. \n• \nThe predictions of dilution rely on the persistence of current speed and direction over time and do not \naccount for any build-up of plume concentrations due to slack currents or current reversals \n• \nThe results for the Case 1, 2 and 3 discharges indicate that the biocide constituent of the hydrotest \ndischarge is not expected to reach the required levels of dilution in the near field mixing zone. \nFar-Field Modelling \n• \nFor Case 1, dilution to reach threshold concentration is achieved for biocide within an area of influence \nextending up to 1,388 m at the 99th percentile. For Case 3, the maximum spatial extents of the relevant \ndilution contour are up to 124 m at the 99th percentile. \n• \nFor Case 1, the area of exposure defined by the relevant dilution contour is predicted to reach a \nmaximum of 2.95 km2 at the 99th percentile. For Case 3, the corresponding maximum area of exposure \nis up to 0.04 km2 at the 99th percentile. \n• \nMaximum depths reached by the discharges are predicted as 930 m (seabed) and 12 m for Cases 1 \nand 3, respectively. \nKey Observations \n• \nDue to the significant variations in magnitude of the hindcast currents between the surface and seabed, \nwhere potential discharges will occur, predicted outcomes are markedly different. \n• \nThe greater strength and variability in surface-layer currents will promote the highest levels of mixing \nand dilution, while transport patterns at the seabed will be dictated almost solely by tidal movements. \n• \nBecause the discharge will be initially neutrally-buoyant, it will travel laterally in the water column and \neven a surface discharge is unlikely to resurface in the vicinity of the discharge point prior to \nacclimation with ambient receiving water conditions. \n• \nOutcomes show that below-threshold biocide concentrations are achieved closer to the discharge point \nfor the surface discharge (220 m3/hr over 20 hours) than for the seabed discharge (795 m3/hr over 44 \nhours). This is partly attributable to the stronger currents at the surface, but primarily to the lower flow \nrate and much lower discharge duration in the surface-discharge case. \n--- Page 672 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 1 \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \n1.1 \nBackground \nRPS was commissioned by Advisian Pty Ltd (Advisian), on behalf of Woodside Energy Ltd (Woodside), to \nundertake a marine dispersion modelling study of proposed hydrotest discharges from subsea \ninfrastructure associated with the Scarborough Project’s Floating Production Unit (FPU). \nThe Scarborough gas resource, located in Commonwealth waters approximately 375 km off the Burrup \nPeninsula, forms part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, comprising the Scarborough, North \nScarborough, Thebe and Jupiter gas fields. \nAs Operator of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, Woodside is proposing to develop the gas resource \nthrough new offshore facilities.

The limits \nof the near-field mixing zone are defined by the area where the levels of mixing and dilution are controlled \nby the plume’s initial jet momentum and the buoyancy flux, resulting from density differences between the \nplume and the receiving water. When the plume encounters a boundary such as the water surface, near-\nfield mixing is complete. At this point, the plume is considered to enter the far-field mixing zone. \nThe scope of the modelling included the following components: \n• \nCollation of a suitable three-dimensional, spatially-varying current data set surrounding the FPU \nlocation for a ten-year (2006-2015) hindcast period. The current data set included the combined \ninfluence of drift and tidal currents and was suitably long as to be indicative of interannual variability in \nocean currents. The current data set was validated against metocean data collected in the \nScarborough Project area. \n• \nDerivation of statistical distributions for the current speed and directions for use in the near-field \nmodelling. Analyses included percentile distributions and development of current roses. This analysis \nwas important to ensure that current data samples applied in the dispersion model were statistically \nrepresentative. \n• \nCollation of seasonally-varying vertical water density profiles at the FPU location for use as input to \nthe dispersion models. \n• \nNear-field modelling conducted for each unique discharge to assess the initial mixing of the discharge \ndue to turbulence and subsequent entrainment of ambient water. This modelling was conducted at \nhigh spatial and temporal resolution (scales of metres and seconds, respectively). \n• \nOutcomes from the near-field modelling included estimates of the width, shape and orientation of the \nplumes, and resulting contaminant concentrations and dilutions, for each discharge at a range of \nincident current speeds. \n• \nEstablishment of a far-field dispersion model to repeatedly assess discharge scenarios under different \nsample conditions, with each sample represented by a unique time-sequence of current flow, chosen \nat random from the time series of current data. \n• \nAnalysis of the results of all simulations to quantify, by return frequency, the potential extent and shape \nof the mixing zone. \n--- Page 676 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 5 \n2 \nMODELLING METHODS \n2.1 \nNear-Field Modelling \n2.1.1 Overview \nNumerical modelling was applied to quantify the area of influence of hydrotest water discharges, in terms \nof the distribution of the maximum contaminant concentrations that might occur with distance from the \nsource given defined discharge configurations, source concentrations, and the distribution of the metocean \nconditions affecting the discharge location. \nThe dispersion of the hydrotest discharge will depend, initially, on the geometry and hydrodynamics of the \ndischarges themselves, where the induced momentum and buoyancy effects dominate over background \nprocesses. This region is generally referred to as the near-field zone and is characterised by variations over \nshort time and space scales. As the discharges mix with the ambient waters, the momentum and buoyancy \nsignatures are eroded, and the background – or ambient – processes become dominant. \nThe shape and orientation of the discharged water plumes, and hence the distribution and dilution rate of \nthe plume, will vary significantly with natural variation in prevailing water currents. Therefore, to best \ncalculate the likely outcomes of the discharges, it is necessary to simulate discharge under a statistically \nrepresentative range of current speeds representative of the FPU location. \n2.1.2 Description of Near-Field Model: Updated Merge \nThe near-field mixing and dispersion of the water discharge was simulated using the Updated Merge (UM3) \nflow model. The UM3 model is a three-dimensional Lagrangian steady-state plume trajectory model \ndesigned for simulating single and multiple-port submerged discharges in a range of configurations, \navailable within the Visual Plumes modelling package provided by the United States Environmental \nProtection Agency (Frick et al., 2003). The UM3 model was selected because it has been extensively tested \nfor various discharges and found to predict observed dilutions more accurately (Roberts & Tian, 2004) than \nother near-field models (i.e. RSB and CORMIX). \nIn the UM3 model, the equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are solved at each time \nstep, giving the dilution along the plume trajectory. To determine the change of each term, UM3 follows the \nshear (or Taylor) entrainment hypothesis and the projected-area-entrainment (PAE) hypothesis, which \nquantifies forced entrainment in the presence of a background ocean current. The flows begin as round \nbuoyant jets and can merge to a plane buoyant jet (Carvalho et al., 2002). Model output consists of plume \ncharacteristics including centreline dilution, rise-rate, width, centreline height and plume diameter. Dilution \nis reported as the “effective dilution”, the ratio of the initial concentration to the concentration of the plume \nat a given point, following Baumgartner et al. (1994). \nThe near-field zone ends where the discharged plume reaches a physical boundary or assumes the same \ndensity as the ambient water. \nthe idealised representation of the discharge phases. \n \n \n--- Page 677 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 6 \n \nConceptual diagram showing the general behaviour of negatively buoyant discharge. \n \n2.1.3 Setup of Near-Field Model \n2.1.3.1 Discharge Characteristics \nThe hydrotest discharge characteristics for cases 1 to 3 are summarised in Table 2.1. \nCases 1 and 2 were assumed to occur at a depth of 930 m below mean sea level (BMSL).

In \nthis case, concentrations near the discharge point can be increased due to the discharge plume mixing with \nthe remnant plume from an earlier time. This may be a potential source of episodic increases in pollutant \nconcentrations in the receiving waters. \n2.2.2 Description of Far-Field Model: MUDMAP \nThe mixing and dispersion of the discharges was predicted using the three-dimensional discharge and \nplume behaviour model, MUDMAP (Koh & Chang, 1973; Khondaker, 2000). \nThe far-field calculation (passive dispersion stage) employs a particle-based, random walk procedure. Any \nchemicals/constituents within the discharge stream are represented by a sample of Lagrangian particles. \nThese particles are moved in three dimensions over each subsequent time step according to the prevailing \nlocal current data as well as horizontal and vertical mixing coefficients. \nMUDMAP treats the Lagrangian particles as conservative tracers (i.e. they are not removed over time to \naccount for chemical interactions, decay or precipitation). Predicted concentrations will therefore be \nconservative overestimates where these processes actually do occur. Each particle represents a proportion \nof the discharge, by mass, and particles are released at a given rate to represent the rate of the discharge \n(mass per unit time). Concentrations of constituents are predicted over time by counting the number of \nparticles that occur within a given depth level and grid square and converting this value to mass per unit \nvolume. \nThe system has been extensively validated and applied for discharge operations in Australian waters (e.g. \nBurns et al., 1999; King & McAllister, 1997, 1998). \n2.2.3 Stochastic Modelling \nA stochastic modelling procedure was applied in the far-field modelling to sample a representative set of \nconditions that could affect the distribution of constituents. This approach involves multiple (25) simulations \nof a given discharge scenario and season, with each simulation being carried out under a randomly-\nselected period of currents. This methodology ensures that the calculated movement and fate of each \ndischarge is representative of the range of prevailing currents at the discharge location. Once the stochastic \nmodelling is complete, all simulations are statistically analysed to develop the distribution of outcomes \nbased on time and event. \n2.2.4 Setup of Far-Field Model \n2.2.4.1 Discharge Characteristics \nThe MUDMAP model simulated the discharge into a time-varying current field with the initial dilution set by \nthe near-field results described in Section 2.1. \nTwo hydrotest discharge scenarios were modelled as a continuous discharge using 25 simulations for each \nseason. Once the simulations were complete, they were reported on a seasonal basis: (i) summer \n--- Page 682 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 11 \n(December to February); (ii) transitional (March and September to November) and (iii) winter (April to \nAugust). The hydrotest discharge characteristics for the selected cases (Trunkline and SURF 2) are \nsummarised in Table 2.5.

Both coefficients are expressed in units of rate of area change \nper second (m2/s). Increasing the horizontal dispersion coefficient will increase the horizontal spread of the \ndischarge plume and decrease the centreline concentrations faster. Increasing the vertical dispersion \ncoefficient spreads the discharge across the vertical layers (or depths) faster. \nSpatially constant, conservative dispersion coefficients of 0.15 m2/s and 0.00005 m2/s were used to control \nthe spreading of the hydrotest plume in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Each of the \nmixing parameters was selected following extensive sensitivity testing to recreate the plume characteristics \npredicted by the near-field modelling. It would be expected that the in-situ mixing dynamics would be greater \nunder average and high energy conditions by a factor of 10 (King & McAllister, 1997, 1998) and thus the \nfar-field model results are designed to produce a worst-case result for concentration extents. \n--- Page 683 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 12 \nMUDMAP uses a three-dimensional grid to represent the geographic region under study (water depth and \nbathymetric profiles). Due to the rapid mixing and small-scale effect of the effluent discharge, it was \nnecessary to use a fine grid with a resolution of 5 m x 5 m to track the movement and fate of the discharge \nplume. The extent of the grid region measured approximately 5 km (longitude or x-axis) by 5 km (latitude \nor y-axis), which was subdivided horizontally into 1,000 x 1,000 cells. The vertical resolution was set to 1 m. \n2.2.5 Regional Ocean Currents \n2.2.5.1 Background \nThe area of interest for this study is typified by strong tidal flows over the shallower regions, particularly \nalong the inshore region of the North West Shelf and among the island groups stretching from the Dampier \nArchipelago to the North West Cape. However, the offshore regions with water depths exceeding 100-\n200 m experience significant large-scale drift currents. These drift currents can be relatively strong (1-2 \nknots) and complex, manifesting as a series of eddies, meandering currents and connecting flows. These \noffshore drift currents also tend to persist longer (days to weeks) than tidal current flows (hours between \nreversals) and thus will have greater influence upon the net trajectory of slicks over time scales exceeding \na few hours. \nWind shear on the water surface also generates local-scale currents that can persist for extended periods \n(hours to days) and result in long trajectories. Hence, the current-induced transport of pollutants can be \nvariably affected by combinations of tidal, wind-induced and density-induced drift currents. Depending on \ntheir local influence, it is critical to consider all these potential advective mechanisms to rigorously \nunderstand patterns of potential transport from a given discharge location. \nTo appropriately allow for temporal and spatial variation in the current field, dispersion modelling requires \nthe current speed and direction over a spatial grid covering the potential migration of pollutants. As \nmeasured current data is not available for simultaneous periods over a network of locations covering the \nwide area of this study, the analysis relied upon hindcasts of the circulation generated by numerical \nmodelling. Estimates of the net currents were derived by combining predictions of the drift currents, \navailable from mesoscale ocean models, with estimates of the tidal currents generated by an RPS model \nset up for the study area. \n2.2.5.2 Mesoscale Circulation Model \nRepresentation of the drift currents that affect the area were available from the output of the BRAN (Bluelink \nReANalysis; Oke et al., 2008, 2009; Schiller et al., 2008) ocean model, which is sponsored by the Australian \nGovernment through the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), Royal Australian Navy, and \nCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). BRAN is a data-assimilative, \nthree-dimensional ocean model that has been run as a hindcast for many periods and is now used for \nocean forecasting (Schiller et al., 2008). \nThe BRAN predictions for drift currents are produced at a horizontal spatial resolution of approximately 0.1° \nover the region, at a frequency of once per day, averaged over the 24-hour period. Hence, the BRAN model \ndata provides estimates of mesoscale circulation with horizontal resolution suitable to resolve eddies of a \nfew tens of kilometres’ diameter, as well as connecting stream currents of similar spatial scale. Drift currents \nthat are represented over the inner shelf waters in the BRAN data are principally attributable to wind induced \ndrift. \n--- Page 684 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 13 \nThere are several versions of the BRAN database available. The latest BRAN simulation spans the period \nof January 1994 to August 2016. From this database, time series of current speed and direction were \nextracted for all points in the model domain for the years 2006-2015 (inclusive). The data was assumed to \nbe a suitably representative sample of the current conditions over the study area for future years. \nto the FPU location. Note that the convention for defining current direction is the direction towards which \nthe current flows. \nThe data shows that current speeds and directions vary between seasons. In general, during transitional \nmonths (March and September to November) currents have the strongest average speed (0.22 m/s with a \nmaximum of 0.56 m/s) and tend to flow south-east. During winter (April to August), current flow conditions \nare more variable, with lower average speed (0.21 m/s with a maximum of 0.53 m/s). During summer \n(December to February), the current flow occurs in a predominantly south/south-westerly direction with the \nlowest average speed (0.20 m/s with a maximum of 0.46 m/s). \n \n \nSeasonal current distribution (2006-2015, inclusive) derived from the BRAN database \nnear to the proposed FPU location. The colour key shows the current magnitude, the \ncompass direction provides the direction towards which the current is flowing, and the \nsize of the wedge gives the percentage of the record. \n \n2.2.5.3 Tidal Circulation Model \nAs the BRAN model does not include tidal forcing, and because the data is only available at a daily \nfrequency, a tidal model was developed for the study region using RPS’ three-dimensional hydrodynamic \nmodel, HYDROMAP. \nThe model formulations and output (current speed, direction and sea level) of this model have been \nvalidated through field measurements around the world for more than 25 years (Isaji & Spaulding, 1984, \n1986; Isaji et al., 2001; Zigic et al., 2003). HYDROMAP current data has also been widely used as input to \n--- Page 685 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 14 \nforecasts and hindcasts of oil spill migrations in Australian waters. This modelling system forms part of the \nNational Marine Oil Spill Contingency Plan for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA, 2002). \nHYDROMAP simulates the flow of ocean currents within a model region due to forcing by astronomical \ntides, wind stress and bottom friction. The model employs a sophisticated dynamically nested-gridding \nstrategy, supporting up to six levels of spatial resolution within a single domain. This allows for higher \nresolution of currents within areas of greater bathymetric and coastline complexity, or of particular interest \nto a study. \nThe numerical solution methodology of HYDROMAP follows that of Davies (1977a, 1977b) with further \ndevelopments for model efficiency by Owen (1980) and Gordon (1982). A more detailed presentation of \nthe model can be found in Isaji & Spaulding (1984). \nA HYDROMAP model was established over a domain that extended approximately 3,300 km east-west by \n3,100 km north-south over the eastern Indian Ocean. The grid extends beyond Eucla in the south and \nbeyond Bathurst Island in the north (Figure 2.3). \nFour layers of sub-gridding were applied to provide variable resolution throughout the domain. The \nresolution at the primary level was 15 km. The finer levels were defined by subdividing these cells into 4, \n16 and 64 cells, resulting in resolutions of 7.5 km, 3.75 km and 1.88 km. The finer grids were allocated in \na step-wise fashion to areas where higher resolution of circulation patterns was required to resolve flows \nthrough channels, around shorelines or over more complex bathymetry. Approximately 98,600 cells were \nused to define the region. \nBathymetric data used to define the three-dimensional shape of the study domain was extracted from the \nCMAP electronic chart database and supplemented where necessary with manual digitisation of chart data \nsupplied by the Australian Hydrographic Office. Depths in the domain ranged from shallow intertidal areas \nthrough to approximately 7,200 m. \nOcean boundary data for the HYDROMAP model was obtained from the TOPEX/Poseidon global tidal \ndatabase (TPXO7.2) of satellite-measured altimetry data, which provided estimates of tidal amplitudes and \nphases for the eight dominant tidal constituents (designated as K2, S2, M2, N2, K1, P1, O1 and Q1) at a \nhorizontal scale of approximately 0.25°. Using the tidal data, sea surface heights are firstly calculated along \nthe open boundaries at each time step in the model. \nThe TOPEX/Poseidon satellite data is produced, and quality controlled by the US National Atmospheric \nand Space Agency (NASA). The satellites, equipped with two highly accurate altimeters capable of taking \nsea level measurements accurate to less than ±5 cm, measured oceanic surface elevations (and the \nresultant tides) for over 13 years (1992-2005). In total, these satellites carried out more than 62,000 orbits \nof the planet. The TOPEX/Poseidon tidal data has been widely used amongst the oceanographic \ncommunity, being the subject of more than 2,100 research publications (e.g. Andersen, 1995; Ludicone et \nal., 1998; Matsumoto et al., 2000; Kostianoy et al., 2003; Yaremchuk & Tangdong, 2004; Qiu & Chen, \n2010). As such, the TOPEX/Poseidon tidal data is considered suitably accurate for this study. \nFor the purpose of verification of the tidal predictions, the model output was compared against independent \npredictions of tides using the XTide database (Flater, 1998). The XTide database contains harmonic tidal \nconstituents derived from measured water level data at locations around the world. Of more than 40 tidal \nstations within the HYDROMAP model domain, ten were used for comparison. \nWater level time series for these locations are shown in Figure 2.4 for a one-month period (January 2005). \nAll comparisons show that the model produces a very good match to the known tidal behaviour for a wide \n--- Page 686 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 15 \nrange of tidal amplitudes and clearly represents the varying diurnal and semi-diurnal nature of the tidal \nsignal. \nThe model skill was further evaluated through a comparison of the predicted and observed tidal \nconstituents, derived from an analysis of model-predicted time-series at each location. A scatter plot of the \nobserved and modelled amplitude (top) and phase (bottom) of the five dominant tidal constituents (S2, M2, \nN2, K1 and O1) is presented in Figure 2.5. The red line on each plot shows the 1:1 line, which would indicate \na perfect match between the modelled and observed data.

Any dilution \nrates indicated in red show that suitable dilution is not achieved during the near-field stage for at least one \ncurrent-speed case. \ndilution and temperature of the plume under varying discharge rates (795 m3/hr and 220 m3/hr), depths (930 m \nand 10 m), seasonal conditions (summer, transitional, winter and annual) and current speeds (weak, medium \nand strong). The figures show the predicted horizontal distances travelled by the plume before the trapping \ndepth is reached (i.e. before the plume becomes neutrally buoyant). \nThe results show that due to the momentum of the discharge a turbulent mixing zone is created in the \nimmediate vicinity of the discharge point, which is 930 m (Cases 1 and 2) and 10 m (Case 3) below the water \nsurface. The surface discharges are shown to increase the extent of the turbulent mixing zone. Following this \ninitial mixing, the near neutrally-buoyant plumes are predicted to travel laterally in the water column. For Cases \n1 and 2, the plumes are predicted to remain close to the seabed. For Case 3, the plume is predicted to plunge \nup to 19 m below the sea surface depending on season. For Cases 2 and 3, increased ambient current \nstrengths are shown to increase the horizontal distance travelled by the plumes from the discharge point. \nrates, depths, seasonal conditions and current speeds. The plume will reach a maximum horizontal distance \nof between 7 m and 152 m before reaching the trapping depth. \nThe diameter of the plume at the end of the near-field zone ranged from 10 m to 23 m. Increases in current \nspeed serve to restrict the diameter of the plume. \nFor most combinations of season, flow rate and discharge depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the \nplume is the strength of the ambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach the \ntrapping depth closer to the discharge point, which slows the rate of dilution (Table 3.1, Table 3.6 and Table \n3.11). The average dilution levels of the plume upon reaching the trapping depth under medium and strong \ncurrents are predicted to be 1:90 and 1:81 for Case 1, 1:465 and 1:629 for Case 2, and 1:482 and 1:641 for \nCase 3, respectively. Note that predictions of dilution rely on the persistence of current speed and direction \nover time and do not account for any build-up of plume concentrations due to slack currents or current \nreversals. \nThe results for the Case 1 (Section 3.1.2.1; Table 3.2 to Table 3.5), Case 2 (Section 3.1.2.2; Table 3.7 to \nconstituent of the hydrotest discharge is not expected to reach the required levels of dilution in the near-field \nmixing zone. \n--- Page 692 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 21 \n3.1.2 Results – Tables and Figures \n3.1.2.1 Discharge Case 1: Trunkline Hydrotest Discharge at 930 m Depth \n \nPredicted plume characteristics at the end of the near-field mixing zone for the \ntrunkline hydrotest discharge for each season and current speed. \nSeason \nSurface \nCurrent \nSpeed (m/s) \nPlume \nDiameter (m) \nat Depth [m] \nPlume \nTemperature \n(°C) \nPlume-\nAmbient \nTemperature \nDifference \n(°C) \nPlume Dilution (1:x) \nMaximum \nHorizontal \nDistance (m) \nMinimum \nAverage \nSummer \nWeak (0.04) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.74 \n0.00 \n52 \n97 \n23.8 \nMedium (0.16) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.74 \n0.00 \n52 \n90 \n21.1 \nStrong (0.33) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.74 \n0.00 \n55 \n81 \n18.1 \nTransitional \nWeak (0.05) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.71 \n0.00 \n52 \n97 \n23.7 \nMedium (0.18) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.71 \n0.00 \n53 \n90 \n21.0 \nStrong (0.38) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.71 \n0.00 \n54 \n78 \n17.2 \nWinter \nWeak (0.04) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.76 \n0.00 \n52 \n97 \n23.8 \nMedium (0.17) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.76 \n0.00 \n53 \n90 \n21.1 \nStrong (0.40) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.76 \n0.00 \n54 \n80 \n17.6 \nAnnual \nWeak (0.04) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.73 \n0.00 \n52 \n97 \n23.8 \nMedium (0.17) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.73 \n0.00 \n53 \n90 \n21.0 \nStrong (0.37) \n10.0 [925.0] \n5.73 \n0.00 \n55 \n80 \n17.6 \n \nConcentration of biocide at the end of the near-field stage, and the required \nconcentration threshold and number of dilutions for the summer season.

The far-field results included \nepisodes of pooling of the discharge plume under weak currents, which caused lower dilutions (higher \nconcentrations) further from the discharge location when the pooled plume was advected away. Episodes \nof recirculation – where the plume moved back under the discharge at some later time due to the oscillatory \nnature of the tide – were also observed, compounding the pooling effect and further lowering the dilution \nvalues. \n3.2.2 Interpretation of Percentile Dilution Contours \nFor each of the modelled discharge cases, the results for all simulations were combined and a statistical \nanalysis performed to produce percentile contours of dilution. In the following sections, outcomes based on \n95th and 99th percentile dilution contours are presented. \nCalculation of 95th and 99th percentile statistics is a common approach to assessing the impact of dispersing \nplumes and captures the variability in outcomes, for all but the most ephemeral of forcing conditions, in the \ndata set under consideration. Impact assessment criteria for water quality are often defined using similar \nstatistical indicators. \nNote that the percentile figures do not represent the location of a plume at any point in time; they are a \nstatistical and spatial summary of the percentage of time that particular dilution values occur across all \nreplicate simulations and time steps. For example, if the 95th percentile minimum dilution at a particular \nlocation in the model domain is predicted as a value of 100, this means that for 95% of the time the dilution \nlevel will be higher than 100 and for only 5% of the time the dilution level will be lower than 100. A \ncomparison of the plume extents shown in Figure 3.13 with those shown in Sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 \ndemonstrates the significant difference between an instantaneous snapshot and a cumulative estimate of \ncoverage over several days and many individual simulations. \nDilution contours are calculated from the ratios of dispersing contaminant concentrations in the receiving \nwaters to the initial concentration of the contaminant in the discharge. Note that this assumes the \nbackground concentration of the constituent in the receiving waters is zero and there is no significant \nbiodegradation of the discharged constituent over the short duration of the dispersion process. \nconcentrations required to yield particular dilution levels (1:100, 1:200 and 1:400). These concentrations \nmay be useful to consider when interpreting the contour plots of percentile dilutions. \n \n \n--- Page 711 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 40 \nInitial concentrations of biocide and equivalent concentrations at example dilution \nlevels. \nBiocide Parameter \nBiocide Concentration (mg/L) \nInitial concentration in discharge \n550.0 \nInitial concentration in receiving waters \n0.0 \nConcentration at 1:100 dilution \n5.5 \nConcentration at 1:200 dilution \n2.75 \nConcentration at 1:400 dilution \n1.375 \n \n3.2.3 General Observations \nhour intervals from 04:00 to 19:00 on 4th February 2010. This simulation – selected merely to be \nrepresentative of typical conditions – considers the Case 1 flow rate of 795 m3/d at 930 m BMSL. The \nspatially-varying orientation of the plume with the currents and the rapidly-varying nature of the \nconcentrations around the source can be observed. The snapshots also show the combined effect of the \ntide and the drift currents, with a clear tidal oscillation. \nThese snapshots illustrate that the dilutions (and in turn concentrations) become more variable over time \nbecause of changes in current speed and direction. Higher dilutions (lower concentrations) are predicted \nduring periods of increased current speed, whereas patches of lower dilutions (higher concentrations) tend \nto accumulate during the turning of the tide or during periods of weak drift currents. During prolonged \nperiods of lowered current speed, the plume has a more continuous appearance, with higher-concentration \npatches moving as a unified group. These findings agree with the research of King & McAllister (1997, \n1998) who noted that concentrations within effluent plumes generated by an offshore platform were patchy \nand likely to peak around the reversal of the tides. \n \n \n--- Page 712 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 41 \n \nFebruary 2010, for Case 1 (930 m depth discharge at 795 m3/hr flow rate). \n--- Page 713 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 42 \n3.2.4 Seasonal Analysis \nThe model outputs over the ten-year hindcast period (2006-2015) were combined and analysed on a \nseasonal basis (summer, transitional and winter). This approach assists with identifying the potential \nexposure to surrounding sensitive receptors whilst considering inter-annual variability in ocean current \nconditions. \nspecific radial distances from the discharge location for each season and percentile. \nfrom the discharge location to achieve 1:550 dilution for each season and percentile. The results indicate \nthat the release of effluent under all seasonal conditions results in rapid dispersion within the ambient \nenvironment. For Case 1, dilution to reach threshold concentration is achieved for biocide within an area of \ninfluence ranging from 1,173 m to 1,196 m at the 95th percentile across all seasons (Table 3.19). For Case \n3, the maximum spatial extent of the relevant dilution contour is 18 m at the 95th percentile across all \nseasons (Table 3.20). The greatest spatial extents are observed in the transitional months. \nfor the 1:550 dilution contour for each season and percentile. For Case 1, the area of exposure defined by \nthe relevant dilution contour is predicted to reach maximums of 2.21 km2 to 2.30 km2 at the 95th percentile \n(Table 3.21). For Case 3, the corresponding maximum area of exposure is <0.01 km2 at the 95th percentile \n(Table 3.22). \nfrom the discharge location to achieve 1:550 dilution for each season and percentile. Maximum depths are \npredicted as 930 m (seabed; all seasons) and 12 m (all seasons) for Case 1 and Case 3, respectively. \nFor Cases 1 and 3, Figure 3.14 to Figure 3.25 show the aggregated spatial extents of the minimum dilutions \nfor each season and percentile. Note that the contours represent the lowest predicted dilution (highest \nconcentration) at any given time-step through the water column and do not consider frequency or duration. \nThe results presented assume that no processes other than dilution would reduce the source \nconcentrations over time. \n \n--- Page 714 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest

The surface discharges are shown to increase the extent of the turbulent mixing zone. \nFollowing this initial mixing, the near neutrally-buoyant plumes are predicted to travel laterally in the water \ncolumn. \n• \nFor Cases 1 and 2, the plumes are predicted to remain close to the seabed. For Case 3, the plume is \npredicted to plunge up to 19 m below the sea surface. For Cases 2 and 3, increased ambient current \nstrengths are shown to increase the horizontal distance travelled by the plumes from the discharge point. \n• \nThe plume will reach a maximum horizontal distance of up to 152 m before reaching the trapping depth \n(at which the predictions of dispersion are halted due to the plume reaching equilibrium with the ambient \nreceiving water). \n• \nThe maximum diameter of the plume at the end of the near-field zone was predicted as 23 m. Increases \nin current speed serve to restrict the diameter of the plume. \n• \nFor each discharge depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the plume is the strength of the \nambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach the trapping depth closer to \nthe discharge point, which slows the rate of dilution. \n• \nFor each combination of discharge flow rate and depth, the primary factor influencing dilution of the plume \nis the strength of the ambient current. Weak currents allow the plume to plunge further and reach the \ntrapping depth closer to the discharge point, which slows the rate of dilution. \n• \nThe average dilution levels of the plume upon reaching the trapping depth under average current speeds \nare predicted to be 1:90 for Case 1, 1:465 for Case 2 and 1:482 for Case 3. \n• \nThe predictions of dilution rely on the persistence of current speed and direction over time and do not \naccount for any build-up of plume concentrations due to slack currents or current reversals \n• \nThe results for the Case 1, 2 and 3 discharges indicate that the biocide constituent of the hydrotest \ndischarge is not expected to reach the required levels of dilution in the near field mixing zone. \nFar-Field Modelling \n• \nFor Case 1, dilution to reach threshold concentration is achieved for biocide within an area of influence \nextending up to 1,388 m at the 99th percentile. For Case 3, the maximum spatial extents of the relevant \ndilution contour are up to 124 m at the 99th percentile. \n• \nFor Case 1, the area of exposure defined by the relevant dilution contour is predicted to reach a \nmaximum of 2.95 km2 at the 99th percentile. For Case 3, the corresponding maximum area of exposure \nis up to 0.04 km2 at the 99th percentile. \n• \nMaximum depths reached by the discharges are predicted as 930 m (seabed) and 12 m for Cases 1 \nand 3, respectively. \n--- Page 738 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 67 \nKey Observations \n• \nDue to the significant variations in magnitude of the hindcast currents between the surface and seabed, \nwhere potential discharges will occur, predicted outcomes are markedly different. \n• \nThe greater strength and variability in surface-layer currents will promote the highest levels of mixing \nand dilution, while transport patterns at the seabed will be dictated almost solely by tidal movements. \n• \nBecause the discharge will be initially neutrally-buoyant, it will travel laterally in the water column and \neven a surface discharge is unlikely to resurface in the vicinity of the discharge point prior to \nacclimation with ambient receiving water conditions. \n• \nOutcomes show that below-threshold biocide concentrations are achieved closer to the discharge point \nfor the surface discharge (220 m3/hr over 20 hours) than for the seabed discharge (795 m3/hr over 44 \nhours). This is partly attributable to the stronger currents at the surface, but primarily to the lower flow \nrate and much lower discharge duration in the surface-discharge case. \n \n--- Page 739 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Hydrotest Discharge Modelling  |  Rev 2  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 68 \n5 \nREFERENCES \nPerth, WA, Australia. \nAndersen, OB 1995, ‘Global ocean tides from ERS 1 and TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry’, Journal of \nGeophysical Research: Oceans, vol. 100, no.

These will be connected to the mainland through an approximately 430 km \ntrunkline. \nThe Scarborough gas field consists of gas which is classified as ‘dry’ with only trace levels of condensate, and \nas such a loss of well control event will not have a significant liquid component. As such, the exposure from \nan unplanned hydrocarbon release is based on a release of marine diesel oil (MDO) from a vessel. \nThe assessment focused on the risk of exposure to hydrocarbons for surrounding resources and sensitive \nreceptors if defined spill scenarios were to occur. The main objectives of the study were to provide an \nassessment, through stochastic spill modelling, of the probabilities of oil contact (at greater than defined \nminimum concentrations), the potential concentrations that might be involved, and the minimum state of \nweathering of the oil in case of a release of hydrocarbons. \nWoodside identified three hydrocarbon spill scenarios for investigation. Each scenario was modelled in a \nstochastic manner and assessed over an annual period in this study. \nOil spill modelling was undertaken using a three-dimensional oil spill trajectory and weathering model, SIMAP \n(Spill Impact Mapping and Analysis Program), which is designed to simulate the transport, spreading and \nweathering of specific oil types under the influence of changing meteorological and oceanographic forces. \nThe main findings of this study are as follows: \nMetocean Influences \n• \nTidal flows will have a significant influence on the trajectory of any oil spilled at the modelled release sites, \nirrespective of the seasonal conditions. \n• \nLarge-scale drift currents will have a significant influence on the trajectory of any oil spilled at the modelled \nrelease sites, irrespective of the seasonal conditions. The prevailing drift currents will determine the \ntrajectory of oil that is entrained beneath the water surface. \n• \nInteractions with the prevailing wind will provide additional variation in the trajectory of spilled oil. \n• \nDue to the location of the hypothetical spill site and the dominance of tidal flows, the coastal areas \npredicted to be most likely to be impacted by spilled oil are those bordering Mermaid Sound and its \nnumerous passages. \nOil Characteristics and Weathering Behaviour \n• \nMarine diesel is a mixture of volatile and persistent hydrocarbons with low percentages of highly volatile \nand residual components. If exposed to the atmosphere, around 41% of the mass would be expected to \nevaporate in around 24 hours, another 54% within a few days, and the remaining 5% would be expected \n--- Page 755 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage xiv \nto persist in the marine environment until decayed. The influence of entrainment will regulate the degree \nof mass retention in the environment. \n• \nDuring the surface release, floating oil will be susceptible to entrainment into the wave-mixed layer under \ntypical wind conditions. Evaporation rates will be significant, given the moderate proportion of volatile \ncompounds in the oil (41%). The low-volatility fraction of the oil (54%) will take longer durations of the \norder of days to evaporate, and the residual fraction of 5% is expected to persist in the environment until \ndegradation processes occur. Considering the spill volume, there is a low potential for dissolution of \nsoluble aromatic compounds. \nSummary of Stochastic Assessment Results \nScenario 1: Short-Term (Instantaneous) Surface

spill risk assessment of three hydrocarbon spill scenarios related to the Scarborough \nProject. \nThe Scarborough gas resource, located in Commonwealth waters approximately 375 km off the Burrup \nPeninsula, forms part of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, comprising the Scarborough, North Scarborough, \nThebe and Jupiter gas fields. \nAs Operator of the Greater Scarborough gas fields, Woodside is proposing to develop the gas resource \nthrough new offshore facilities. These will be connected to the mainland through an approximately 430 km \ntrunkline. \nThe Scarborough gas field consists of gas which is classified as ‘dry’ with only trace levels of condensate, and \nas such a loss of well control event will not have a significant liquid component.

Each scenario was \nmodelled in a stochastic manner and assessed over an annual period in this study. \nThe regional context of the spill location for each assessed scenario is shown in Figure 1.1. \nThe details of the scenarios assessed in this study are summarised in Table 1.1 and listed here: \n• \nScenario 1: A short-term (instantaneous) surface release of 2,000 m3 of marine diesel, representing loss \nof vessel fuel tank integrity after a collision outside Mermaid Sound (20° 21' 3.28\" S, 116° 42' 5.58\" E). \n• \nScenario 2: A short-term (instantaneous) surface release of 2,000 m3 of marine diesel, representing loss \nof vessel fuel tank integrity after a collision within Montebello Marine Park (MP) (20° 03' 1.44\" S, \n115° 31' 35.04\" E). \n• \nScenario 3: A short-term (instantaneous) surface release of 2,000 m3 of marine diesel, representing loss \nof vessel fuel tank integrity after a collision at the FPU location (19° 53' 54.72\" S, 113° 14' 19.56\" E). \n \n--- Page 758 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 2 \n \nLocations of the modelled hydrocarbon spill scenario release sites. \n \n--- Page 759 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 3 \n1.2 \nStochastic Modelling of Spill Scenarios \nOil spill modelling was undertaken using a three-dimensional oil spill trajectory and weathering model, SIMAP \n(Spill Impact Mapping and Analysis Program), which is designed to simulate the transport, spreading and \nweathering of specific oil types under the influence of changing meteorological and oceanographic forces. \nThe SIMAP model simulates both surface and subsurface releases and uses the unique physical and chemical \nproperties of an oil type to calculate rates of evaporation and viscosity change, including the tendency to form \noil-in-water emulsions. Moreover, the unique transport and dispersion of surface slicks and in-water \ncomponents (entrained and dissolved) are modelled separately. Thus, the model can be used to understand \nthe wider potential consequences of a spill, including direct contact to slick oil for surface features and exposure \nto entrained and dissolved oil for organisms in the water column. \nTo define trends and variations in the potential outcomes of a given scenario, a stochastic modelling scheme \nwas followed in this study, whereby SIMAP was applied to repeatedly simulate the defined spill scenarios using \ndifferent samples of current and wind data selected randomly from an historic time-series of wind and current \ndata representative of the study area. Results of the replicate simulations were then statistically analysed and \nmapped to define contours of risk around the release point. \nFor this purpose, a long-term archive of spatially-variable wind and current data covering the North West Shelf \nof Australia and spanning 10 years (2006-2015, inclusive) was assembled. Current patterns accounted for \ntemporal and spatial variations in large-scale drift currents over the outer shelf waters (typically >200 m depth) \ntogether with tidal and wind-driven currents. Modelling was carried out using current and wind data sampled \nfrom the data archive to quantify annualised risks of contact at surrounding locations. \nEach simulation was run for the duration of the specified spill, plus a further period after the cessation of \ndischarge to allow a sufficient time period for oil concentrations to decrease below the threshold concentrations \napplied in the analysis. It is expected that remnant floating oil, which may be present at low thresholds at the \nend of each simulation, would represent highly weathered and degraded products. \nIt is important to note that the modelling results presented in this document relate to the predicted outcomes \nonce defined spill events have occurred. The probability of the spill scenarios occurring is not considered. The \nresults should therefore be viewed as a guide to the likely outcomes should the spill scenarios occur. \nFurthermore, the results are presented in terms of statistical probability maps, based on many simulations \nunder different conditions. Different locations within the potential zone of influence would be affected under \neach different time-series of environmental forces. Consequently, these contours for the potential zone of \ninfluence will cover a larger area than the area that is likely to be affected during any one single spill event. \nThe contours should therefore be judged as contours of probability and not representations of the area swept \nby individual spill slicks. \nRisk estimates were calculated from the multiple replicate simulations for each assessed scenario, including \nthe probability of contact, the minimum time to contact, and the potential concentrations that might be involved. \nThe results of the stochastic modelling are presented in Section 3. \n \n \n--- Page 760 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 4 \nSummary of the hydrocarbon spill scenarios assessed in a stochastic manner in this \nstudy. \nScenario \nDescription \nOil Type \nSpilled \nVolume \n(m3) \nRelease \nCoordinates \nRelease \nDepth \n(m BMSL) \nSpill Duration \nSimulation \nDuration \nPeriod \n1 \nLoss of vessel fuel tank \nintegrity after a collision \noutside Mermaid Sound \nMarine Diesel \n2,000 \n20° 21' 03.28\" \nS \n116° 42' 05.58\n\" E \n0 \nInstantaneous \n42 days \nAnnual \n2 \nLoss of vessel fuel tank \nintegrity after a collision \nwithin Montebello \nMarine Park (MP) \nMarine Diesel \n2,000 \n20° 03' 01.44\" \nS \n115° 31' 35.04\n\" E \n0 \nInstantaneous \n42 days \nAnnual \n3 \nLoss of vessel fuel tank \nintegrity after a collision \nat the FPU location \nMarine Diesel \n2,000 \n19° 53' 54.72\" \nS \n113° 14' 19.56\n\" E \n0 \nInstantaneous \n42 days \nAnnual \n \n1.3 \nDeterministic Analysis of Spill Scenarios \nAfter assessing the stochastic modelling outcomes for all scenarios, Woodside determined there was a \nrequirement for additional model outputs to be provided for selected replicate simulations of each scenario in \norder to contextualise the stochastic contours. \nThe results of the deterministic analysis are presented in Section 4. \n1.4 \nReport Structure \nThe far-field computational models, risk assessment methodology, environmental data used as input to the \nmodels, environmental threshold trigger levels defined for the assessment and characteristics of the oil type \nused in the modelling of the defined scenarios are described in detail in Section 2. \nContour figures and tabulated results showing risk estimates for the receptors nominated by Woodside, \nproduced for defined floating oil, entrained oil and dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon threshold concentrations, \nare presented in Section 3 to summarise the stochastic modelling outcomes. \nSpatial figures for floating oil, entrained oil, dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons and shoreline oil are presented \nin Section 4 to summarise the outcomes of the deterministic analysis and modelling. \nThe overall findings of the study are summarised in Section 5. \n \n--- Page 761 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 5 \n2 \nMODELLING METHODOLOGY \n2.1 \nDescription of the SIMAP Model \nThe spill modelling was carried out using a purpose-developed oil spill trajectory and fates model, SIMAP (Spill \nImpact Mapping and Assessment Program). This model is designed to simulate the transport and weathering \nprocesses that affect the outcomes of hydrocarbon spills to the sea, accounting for the specific oil type, spill \nscenario, and prevailing wind and current patterns. \nSIMAP is an evolution of the US EPA Natural Resource Damage Assessment model (French & Rines, 1997; \nFrench, 1998; French et al., 1999) and is designed to simulate the fate and effects of spilled oils and fuels for \nboth the surface slick and the three-dimensional plume that is generated in the water column. SIMAP includes \nalgorithms to account for both physical transport and weathering processes. The latter are important for \naccounting for the partitioning of the spilled mass over time between the water surface (surface slick), water \ncolumn (entrained oil and dissolved compounds), atmosphere (evaporated compounds) and land (stranded \noil). The model also accounts for the interaction between weathering and transport processes. \nThe physical transport algorithms calculate transport and spreading by physical forces, including surface \ntension, gravity and wind and current forces for both surface slicks and oil within the water column. The fates \nalgorithms calculate all of the weathering processes known to be important for oil spilled to marine waters. \nThese include droplet and slick formation, entrainment by wave action, emulsification, dissolution of soluble \ncomponents, sedimentation, evaporation, bacterial and photo-chemical decay and shoreline interactions. \nThese algorithms account for the specific oil type being considered. \nEvaporation rates vary over space and time dependent on the prevailing sea temperatures, wind and current \nspeeds, the surface area of the slick and entrained droplets that are exposed to the atmosphere as well as the \nstate of weathering of the oil. Evaporation rates will decrease over time, depending on the calculated rate of \nloss of the more volatile compounds. By this process, the model can differentiate between the fates of different \noil types. \nEntrainment, dissolution and emulsification rates are correlated to wave energy, which is accounted for by \nestimating wave heights from the sustained wind speed, direction and fetch (i.e. distance downwind from land \nbarriers) at different locations in the domain. Dissolution rates are dependent upon the proportion of soluble, \nshort-chained hydrocarbon compounds, and the surface area at the oil/water interface of slicks. Dissolution \nrates are also strongly affected by the level of turbulence. For example, dissolution rates will be relatively high \nat the site of the release for a deep-sea discharge at high pressure. \nIn contrast, the release of hydrocarbons onto the water surface will not generate high concentrations of soluble \ncompounds. However, subsequent exposure of the surface slick to breaking waves will enhance entrainment \nof oil into the upper water column as oil droplets, which will enhance dissolution of the soluble components. \nBecause the compounds that have high solubility also have high volatility, the processes of evaporation and \ndissolution will be in dynamic competition with the balance dictated by the nature of the release and the weather \nconditions that affect the oil after release. The SIMAP weathering algorithms include terms to represent these \ndynamic processes. Technical descriptions of the algorithms used in SIMAP and validations against real spill \nevents are provided in French (1998), French et al. (1999) and French-McCay (2004). \nInput specifications for oil types include the density, viscosity, pour-point, distillation curve (volume of oil \ndistilled off versus temperature) and the aromatic/aliphatic component ratios within given boiling point ranges. \nThe model calculates a distribution of the oil by mass into the following components: \n• \nSurface-bound or floating oil. \n• \nEntrained oil (non-dissolved oil droplets that are physically entrained by wave action). \n--- Page 762 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 6 \n• \nDissolved hydrocarbons (principally the aromatic and short-chained aliphatic compounds). \n• \nEvaporated hydrocarbons. \n• \nSedimented hydrocarbons. \n• \nDecayed hydrocarbons. \n2.2 \nCalculation of Exposure Risks \nThe stochastic model within SIMAP performs a large number of simulations for a given spill site, randomly \nvarying the spill time for each simulation. The model uses the spill time to select samples of current and wind \ndata from a long time-series of wind and current data for the area. Hence, the transport and weathering of \neach slick will be subject to a different sample of wind and current conditions. \nThis stochastic sampling approach provides an objective measure of the possible outcomes of a spill, because \nenvironmental conditions will be selected at a rate that is proportional to the frequency that these conditions \noccur over the study region. More simulations will tend to use the most commonly occurring conditions, while \nconditions that are more unusual will be represented less frequently. \nDuring each simulation, the SIMAP model records the location (by latitude, longitude and depth) of each of the \nparticles (representing a given mass of oil) on or in the water column, at regular time steps. For any particles \nthat contact a shoreline, the model records the accumulation of oil mass that arrives on each section of \nshoreline over time, less any mass that is lost to evaporation and/or subsequent removal by current and wind \nforces. \nThe collective records from all simulations are then analysed by dividing the study region into a three-\ndimensional grid. For oil particles that are classified as being at the water surface (floating oil), the sum of the \nmass in all oil particles (including accounting for spreading and dispersion effects) located within a grid cell, \ndivided by the area of the cell provides estimates of the concentration of oil in that grid cell, at each time step. \nFor entrained and dissolved oil particles, concentrations are calculated at each time step by summing the mass \nof particles within a grid cell and dividing by the volume of the grid cell. \nThe concentrations of oil calculated for each grid cell, at each time step, are then analysed to determine \nwhether concentration estimates exceed defined threshold concentrations over time. \nRisks are then summarised as follows: \n• \nThe probability of exposure to a location is calculated by dividing the number of spill simulations where \nany instantaneous contact occurred above a specified threshold at that location by the total number of \nreplicate spill simulations. For example, if contact occurred at a location (above a specified threshold) \nduring 21 out of 100 simulations, a probability of exposure of 21% is indicated. \n• \nThe minimum potential time to a shoreline location is calculated by the shortest time over which oil at a \nconcentration above a particular threshold was calculated to travel from the source to the location in any \nof the replicate simulations. \n• \nThe maximum potential concentration of oil predicted for each shoreline section is the greatest mass per \nm2 of shoreline calculated to strand at any location within that section during any of the replicate \nsimulations. \n• \nThe average of the maximum concentrations of oil predicted to potentially accumulate on each shoreline \nsection is calculated by determining the greatest mass per m2 of shoreline during each replicate simulation \nand calculating an average of these estimates across the simulations. Note that this statistic has been \npreviously referred to as the “mean expected maximum” in earlier reports. \n--- Page 763 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 7 \n• \nSimilar treatments are undertaken for entrained oil and dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons. \nThus, the minimum time to shoreline and the maximum potential concentration estimates indicate the worst \npotential outcome of the modelled spill scenario for each section of shoreline. However, the average over the \nreplicates presents an average of the potential outcomes, in terms of oil that could strand. \nNote also that results quoted for sections of shoreline or shoal are derived for any individual location within \nthat section or shoal, as a conservative estimate. Locations will represent shoreline lengths of the order of \n~1 km, while sections or regions will represent shorelines spanning tens to hundreds of kilometres and we do \nnot imply that the maximum potential concentrations quoted will occur over the full extent of each section. We \ntherefore warn against multiplying the maximum concentration estimates by the full area of the section because \nthis will greatly overestimate the total volume expected on that section. \nThe maximum entrained hydrocarbon and maximum dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentration are \ncalculated for water locations surrounding each defined shoreline (see Section 3.1). These zones are defined \nto provide a buffer area around shallow (<10 m) habitats to allow for spatial errors in model forecasts. The \ngreatest calculated value at any time step during any replicate simulation is listed. These values therefore \nrepresent worst-case localised estimates (within a grid cell). The averages over all replicate values represent \na central tendency of these simulated worst-case estimates. \n2.3 \nInputs to the Risk Assessment \n2.3.1 Current Data \n2.3.1.1 Background \nThe area of interest for this study is typified by strong tidal flows over the shallower regions, particularly along \nthe inshore region of the North West Shelf and among the island groups stretching from the Dampier \nArchipelago to the North West Cape. However, the offshore regions with water depths exceeding 100-200 m \nexperience significant large-scale drift currents. These drift currents can be relatively strong (1-2 knots) and \ncomplex, manifesting as a series of eddies, meandering currents and connecting flows. These offshore drift \ncurrents also tend to persist longer (days to weeks) than tidal current flows (hours between reversals) and thus \nwill have greater influence upon the net trajectory of slicks over time scales exceeding a few hours. \nWind shear on the water surface also generates local-scale currents that can persist for extended periods \n(hours to days) and result in long trajectories. Hence, the current-induced transport of oil can be variably \naffected by combinations of tidal, wind-induced and density-induced drift currents. Depending on their local \ninfluence, it is critical to consider all these potential advective mechanisms to rigorously understand patterns \nof potential transport from a given spill location. \nTo appropriately allow for temporal and spatial variation in the current field, spill modelling requires the current \nspeed and direction over a spatial grid covering the potential migration of oil. As measured current data is not \navailable for simultaneous periods over a network of locations covering the wide area of this study, the analysis \nrelied upon hindcasts of the circulation generated by numerical modelling. Estimates of the net currents were \nderived by combining predictions of the drift currents, available from mesoscale ocean models, with estimates \nof the tidal currents generated by an RPS model set up for the study area. \n2.3.1.2 Mesoscale Circulation Model \nRepresentation of the drift currents that affect the area were available from the output of the BRAN (Bluelink \nReANalysis; Oke et al., 2008, 2009; Schiller et al., 2008) ocean model, which is sponsored by the Australian \nGovernment through the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), Royal Australian Navy, and \n--- Page 764 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 8 \nCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). BRAN is a data-assimilative, three-\ndimensional ocean model that has been run as a hindcast for many periods and is now used for ocean \nforecasting (Schiller et al., 2008). \nThe BRAN predictions for drift currents are produced at a horizontal spatial resolution of approximately 0.1° \nover the region, at a frequency of once per day, averaged over the 24-hour period. Hence, the BRAN model \ndata provides estimates of mesoscale circulation with horizontal resolution suitable to resolve eddies of a few \ntens of kilometres’ diameter, as well as connecting stream currents of similar spatial scale. Drift currents that \nare represented over the inner shelf waters in the BRAN data are principally attributable to wind induced drift. \nThere are several versions of the BRAN database available. The latest BRAN simulation spans the period of \nJanuary 1994 to August 2016. From this database, time series of current speed and direction were extracted \nfor all points in the model domain for the years 2006-2015 (inclusive). The data was assumed to be a suitably \nrepresentative sample of the current conditions over the study area for future years. \npoints closest to the spill locations for Scenarios 1 to 3. Note that the convention for defining current direction \nis the direction towards which the current flows. \nThe current data indicates higher average current speeds are characteristic of the May to September period, \nwith the highest average speeds (0.26 m/s) occurring at the Scenario 3 spill site in September. Lower average \ncurrent speeds at the release locations are more common during the February to April period, with lowest \naverage speeds (0.04 m/s) occurring at the Scenario 1 spill site in April. Peak current speeds across all months \nand sites are approximately 0.7 m/s. \nThroughout the year, westerly currents are dominant at the Scenario 2 spill site and westerly/south-westerly \ncurrents are dominant at the Scenario 3 spill site. Current directions at the Scenario 1 spill site are seasonal, \nwith north-easterly currents dominant between September and March, and south-westerly currents dominant \nbetween April and August. \nThe extracted current data near the spill locations provides an insight into the expected initial behaviour of any \nreleased oil due to the drift currents alone. Oil moving beyond the release sites, particularly towards the coast, \nwould be subject to considerable variation in the drift current regime. \n \n \n--- Page 765 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 9 \n \nMonthly current distribution (2006-2015, inclusive) derived from the BRAN database near \nto the Scenario 1 spill location.

HYDROMAP current data has also been widely used as input to forecasts and \nhindcasts of oil spill migrations in Australian waters. This modelling system forms part of the National Marine \nOil Spill Contingency Plan for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA, 2002). \nHYDROMAP simulates the flow of ocean currents within a model region due to forcing by astronomical tides, \nwind stress and bottom friction. The model employs a sophisticated dynamically nested-gridding strategy, \nsupporting up to six levels of spatial resolution within a single domain. This allows for higher resolution of \ncurrents within areas of greater bathymetric and coastline complexity, or of particular interest to a study. \nThe numerical solution methodology of HYDROMAP follows that of Davies (1977a, 1977b) with further \ndevelopments for model efficiency by Owen (1980) and Gordon (1982). A more detailed presentation of the \nmodel can be found in Isaji & Spaulding (1984). \nA HYDROMAP model was established over a domain that extended approximately 3,300 km east-west by \n3,100 km north-south over the eastern Indian Ocean. The grid extends beyond Eucla in the south and beyond \nBathurst Island in the north (Figure 2.4). \nFour layers of sub-gridding were applied to provide variable resolution throughout the domain. The resolution \nat the primary level was 15 km. The finer levels were defined by subdividing these cells into 4, 16 and 64 cells, \nresulting in resolutions of 7.5 km, 3.75 km and 1.88 km. The finer grids were allocated in a step-wise fashion \nto areas where higher resolution of circulation patterns was required to resolve flows through channels, around \nshorelines or over more complex bathymetry. Approximately 98,600 cells were used to define the region. \nBathymetric data used to define the three-dimensional shape of the study domain was extracted from the \nCMAP electronic chart database and supplemented where necessary with manual digitisation of chart data \nsupplied by the Australian Hydrographic Office. Depths in the domain ranged from shallow intertidal areas \nthrough to approximately 7,200 m. \nOcean boundary data for the HYDROMAP model was obtained from the TOPEX/Poseidon global tidal \ndatabase (TPXO7.2) of satellite-measured altimetry data, which provided estimates of tidal amplitudes and \nphases for the eight dominant tidal constituents (designated as K2, S2, M2, N2, K1, P1, O1 and Q1) at a horizontal \nscale of approximately 0.25°. Using the tidal data, sea surface heights are firstly calculated along the open \nboundaries at each time step in the model. \nThe TOPEX/Poseidon satellite data is produced, and quality controlled by the US National Atmospheric and \nSpace Agency (NASA). The satellites, equipped with two highly accurate altimeters capable of taking sea level \nmeasurements accurate to less than ±5 cm, measured oceanic surface elevations (and the resultant tides) for \nover 13 years (1992-2005). In total, these satellites carried out more than 62,000 orbits of the planet. The \nTOPEX/Poseidon tidal data has been widely used amongst the oceanographic community, being the subject \nof more than 2,100 research publications (e.g. Andersen, 1995; Ludicone et al., 1998; Matsumoto et al., 2000; \nKostianoy et al., 2003; Yaremchuk & Tangdong, 2004; Qiu & Chen, 2010). As such, the TOPEX/Poseidon tidal \ndata is considered suitably accurate for this study. \nFor the purpose of verification of the tidal predictions, the model output was compared against independent \npredictions of tides using the XTide database (Flater, 1998). The XTide database contains harmonic tidal \n--- Page 769 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 13 \nconstituents derived from measured water level data at locations around the world. Of more than 40 tidal \nstations within the HYDROMAP model domain, ten were used for comparison. \nWater level time series for these locations are shown in Figure 2.5 for a one-month period (January 2005). All \ncomparisons show that the model produces a very good match to the known tidal behaviour for a wide range \nof tidal amplitudes and clearly represents the varying diurnal and semi-diurnal nature of the tidal signal. \nThe model skill was further evaluated through a comparison of the predicted and observed tidal constituents, \nderived from an analysis of model-predicted time-series at each location. A scatter plot of the observed and \nmodelled amplitude (top) and phase (bottom) of the five dominant tidal constituents (S2, M2, N2, K1 and O1) is \npresented in Figure 2.6. The red line on each plot shows the 1:1 line, which would indicate a perfect match \nbetween the modelled and observed data. Note that the data is generally closely aligned to the 1:1 line \ndemonstrating the high quality of the model performance. \ndata points closest to the spill locations for Scenarios 1 to 3. Note that the convention for defining current \ndirection is the direction towards which the current flows. \nThe current data indicates cyclical tidal flow directions along an east-west axis at the Scenario 1 site, an east-\nsoutheast/west-northwest axis at the Scenario 2 site, and a northeast-southwest axis at the Scenario 3 site. \nMaximum speeds at the Scenario 1 and 2 sites are in the range 0.5-0.6 m/s, with peak speeds at the Scenario \n3 site being around 0.09 m/s. \nThe extracted current data near the spill locations provides an insight into the expected initial behaviour of any \nreleased oil due to the tidal currents alone. Oil moving beyond the release sites, particularly towards the coast, \nwould be subject to considerable variation in the tidal current regime. \n \n \n--- Page 770 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 14 \n \nHydrodynamic model grid (grey wire mesh) used to generate the tidal currents, showing \nlocations available for tidal comparisons (red labelled dots).

The NCEP Climate Forecast System \nReanalysis (CFSR; Saha et al., 2010) is a fully-coupled, data-assimilative hindcast model representing the \ninteraction between the Earth’s oceans, land and atmosphere. The gridded data output, including surface \nwinds, is available at 0.25° resolution and 1-hourly time intervals. \nTime series of wind speed and direction were extracted from the CFSR database for all nodes in the model \ndomain for the same temporal coverage as the current data (2006-2015, inclusive). The data was assumed to \nbe a suitably representative sample of the wind conditions over the study area for future years. \nclosest to the spill locations for Scenarios 1 to 3. Note that the convention for defining wind direction is the \ndirection from which the wind blows. \nThe wind data indicates similar trends in wind direction at the Scenario 1 and 2 spill locations, with \npredominantly easterly directions between May and July, and westerly/south-westerly directions dominating in \nthe October to February period. At the Scenario 3 spill location, easterly/south-easterly directions are most \ncommon between April and August, with southerly directions most prominent between September and March. \nAverage wind speeds across the year at the three spill locations vary in the range 5.9-6.5 m/s, with year-round \nmaximum speeds of 25.5-29.4 m/s. \nThe extracted wind data near the spill location suggests possible initial trajectories due to the wind acting on \nsurface slicks in the absence of any current effects. Note that the actual trajectories of surface slicks will be \nthe net result of a combination of the prevailing wind and current vectors acting at a given time and location. \n \n \n--- Page 777 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 21 \n \nthe Scenario 1 spill location.

WOA13 has a 0.25° \nresolution and has standard depth levels ranging from the water surface to 5,500 m (Locarnini et al., 2013; \nZweng et al., 2013). Vertical profiles of sea temperature and salinity at the spill locations were retrieved from \na data point in the WOA13 database near the Scarborough Project (19° 53’ 54.60” S, 116° 14’ 19.68” E), with \nmonthly averages used as input to SIMAP. \nperiod from May to September, surface mixing is evident over the upper 50-150 m of the water column (where \nthe depth is approximately 1,000 m at this location). In contrast, during the period from October to April, the \nsurface mixed layer is shallower, indicating stronger thermal stratification. The average temperature over the \nupper 200 m of the water column varies between approximately 15-29 °C across the year, while the average \nsalinity over this depth range varies between approximately 34.6-35.8 PSU year-round. \n2.3.4 Dispersion \nA horizontal dispersion coefficient of 5 m2/s was used to account for dispersive processes acting at the surface \nthat are below the scale of resolution of the input current field, based on typical values for coastal waters \n(Okubo, 1971). Dispersion rates within the water column (applicable for entrained and dissolved plumes of \nhydrocarbons) were specified at 1 m2/s, based on empirical data for the dispersion of hydrocarbon plumes \nover the North West Shelf (King & McAllister, 1998). \n2.3.5 Replication \nMultiple replicate simulations were completed for the defined scenarios to account for trends and variations in \nthe trajectory and weathering of spilled oil, with an even number of replicates completed using samples of \nmetocean data that commenced within each month. For Scenarios 1-3, a total of 100 replicate simulations \nwere run over an annual period. \n \n \n--- Page 781 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 25 \n \nnear the Scarborough Project (19° 53' 54.60\" S, 113° 14' 19.68\" E).

Hence, it is useful to define meaningful \nthreshold concentrations for the recording of contact by oil components and determining the probability of \nexposure at a location (calculated from the number of replicate simulations in which this contact occurred). \nThe judgement of meaningful levels is complicated and will depend upon the mode of action, sensitivity of the \nbiota contacted, the duration of the contact and the particular toxicity of the compounds that are represented \nin the oil. The latter factor is further complicated by the change in the composition of an oil type over time due \nto weathering processes. Without specific testing of the oil types, at different states of weathering against a \nwide range of the potential local receptors, such considerations are beyond the scope of this investigation. \nFor this case, thresholds for floating, entrained and dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons were specified by \nWoodside for use in defining the potential zone of influence of the spill event. These thresholds are summarised \nin Table 2.1 and discussed afterwards. \n \nSummary of the thresholds applied in this study. \nFloating Oil Concentration \n(g/m2) \nShoreline Oil \nConcentration (g/m2) \nEntrained Oil \nConcentration (ppb) \nDissolved Aromatic \nHydrocarbon \nConcentration (ppb) \n10 \n100 \n500 \n500 \n50 \n250 \n100 \n \n2.3.6.2 Floating Oil \nFloating oil concentrations are relevant to describing the risks of oil coating emergent reefs, vegetation in the \nlittoral zone and shoreline habitats, as well as the risk to wildlife found on the water surface, such as marine \nmammals, reptiles and birds. Floating oil is also visible at relatively low concentrations (> ~0.05 g/m2). Hence, \nthe area affected by visible oil, which might trigger social or economic impacts, will be larger than the area \nwhere biological impacts might be expected. \nEstimates for the minimal thickness of floating oil that might result in harm to seabirds through ingestion from \npreening of contaminated feathers, or the loss of the thermal protection of their feathers, has been estimated \nby different researchers at approximately 10 g/m2 (French-McCay, 2009) to 25 g/m2 (Koops et al., 2004). \nHence, the 10 g/m2 threshold is likely to be moderately conservative in terms of environmental harm for effects \non seabirds, for example. The lower threshold of 1 g/m2 is likely to be an indicator of where there is a visual \npresence of an oil slick that may trigger social and economic impacts but where there is little potential for \nenvironmental impact. \n--- Page 783 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 27 \nIt is important to note that real spill events generate surface slicks that break up into multiple patches separated \nby areas of open water. Concentrations calculated and presented in this study represent necessary areal \naveraging over discrete model cells, and therefore indicate the potential for both higher and lower relative \nconcentrations in the surrounding space. \n2.3.6.3 Shoreline Oil \nShoreline oil concentrations are relevant to describing the risks of oil contact/stranding on shorelines and \nbeaches. French et al. (1996) and French-McCay (2009) have defined an oil exposure threshold of 100 g/m2 \nfor shorebirds and wildlife (furbearing aquatic mammals and marine reptiles) on or along the shore, which is \nbased on studies for sub-lethal and lethal impacts. The 100 g/m2 threshold has been used in previous \nenvironmental risk assessment studies (French-McCay et al., 2004, 2011, 2012; French-McCay, 2003; NOAA, \n2013b). This threshold is also recommended in the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s foreshore \nassessment guide as the acceptable minimum thickness that does not inhibit the potential for recovery and is \nbest remediated by natural coastal processes alone (AMSA, 2015). The 250 g/m2 threshold is above the \nminimum thresholds observed to cause ecological impact and would therefore be considered high exposure. \n2.3.6.4 Entrained Oil \nOil can be entrained into the water column from surface slicks due to wind and wave-induced turbulence, or \nbe generated subsea by a pressurised discharge at depth. Entrained oil presents a number of possible \nmechanisms for exerting exposure. The entrained oil droplets may contain soluble compounds and hence \nhave the potential to generate elevated concentrations of dissolved hydrocarbons (e.g. if mixed by breaking \nwaves against a shoreline). Physical and chemical effects of the entrained oil droplets have also been \ndemonstrated through direct contact with organisms; for example, through physical coating of gills and body \nsurfaces, or accidental ingestion (NRC, 2005). \nA review of the concentrations of physically entrained oil that has been demonstrated to have harmful effects \nin laboratory studies (NRC, 2005) showed wide variation depending on the test organisms and the initial oil \nmixture. For mortality of molluscs, reported LC50 values range from 500 ppb to 2,000 ppb with 96-hour \nexposure. Wider exposure sensitivities are displayed by species of crustaceans (100 ppb to 258,000 ppm) with \n96-hour exposure, while marine fish larvae appear yet more sensitive with LC50 values as low as 45 ppb after \n24-hour exposure. \nAs an indication of potential exposure, a threshold for concentrations of entrained oil was defined at 500 ppb. \nThis threshold is particularly relevant for short duration (acute) exposure to organisms or fixed habitats affected \nby the dynamically-varying oil plume. A lower threshold, such as 10 ppb – which would be considered a \nconservative estimate of the lowest concentration that may be harmful to sensitive marine organisms over \nrelatively long exposure times (tens of hours; French, 2000) – would be more meaningful for larvae and \norganisms that might be entrained (and therefore moving) within the oil plumes. \n2.3.6.5 Dissolved Aromatic Hydrocarbons \nThe mode of action of soluble hydrocarbons is a narcotic effect resulting from uptake into the tissues of \norganisms. This effect is additive, increasing with exposure concentration or with time of exposure (French, \n2000; NRC, 2005) For many oil mixtures, the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons, and specifically the \npolyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in the water-soluble fraction is the best predictor of the toxicity of the oil. \nAs an indication of potential exposure, a threshold for concentrations of dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons was \ndefined at 500 ppb. Because exposure times may be short (<1-2 hours) in the case of a slick passing over a \nfixed habitat (such as a reef), due to fluctuations in the plume location with changing environmental conditions, \nand because marine organisms can typically tolerate concentrations of toxic hydrocarbons that are two or more \n--- Page 784 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 28 \norders of magnitude higher over such short durations (Pace et al., 1995; French, 2000), the 500 ppb threshold \nis likely to be indicative of potentially harmful exposure to fixed habitats over short exposure durations. \n2.3.7 Oil Characteristics \n2.3.7.1 Overview \nCharacteristics of marine diesel are summarised in Table 2.2. \n \nCharacteristics of the oil type used in the modelling of Scenarios 1-3. \nOil Type \nDensity \n(g/cm3) \nViscosity \n(cP) \nComponent \nVolatile \n(%) \nSemi-Volatile \n(%) \nLow \nVolatility \n(%) \nResidual \n(%) \nAromatics \n(%) \nBoiling point \n(°C) \n<180 \nC4 to C10 \n180 - 265 \nC11 to C15 \n265 - 380 \nC16 to C20 \n>380 \n>C20 \nOf whole oil \n<380 BP \nMarine Diesel \n0.829 \nat 25 °C \n4.000 \nat 25 °C \n% of total \n6.0 \n34.6 \n54.4 \n5.0 \n3.0 \n% aromatics \n1.8 \n1.0 \n0.2 \n- \n- \n \nThe boiling points are dictated by the length of the carbon chains, with the longer and more complex \ncompounds having a higher boiling point, and therefore lower volatility and evaporation rate. \nThe aromatic components within the volatile to low-volatility range are also soluble (with decreasing solubility \nfollowing decreasing volatility) and will dissolve across the oil-water interface. The rate of dissolution will \nincrease with increase in surface area. Hence, dissolution rates will be higher under discharge conditions that \ngenerate smaller oil droplets. \nAtmospheric weathering will commence if and when oil droplets float to the water surface. Typical evaporation \ntimes once the hydrocarbons reach the surface and are exposed to the atmosphere are: \n• \nUp to 12 hours for the C4 to C10 compounds (or less than 180 °C BP); \n• \nUp to 24 hours for the C11 to C15 compounds (180-265 °C BP); \n• \nSeveral days for the C16 to C20 compounds (265-380 °C BP); and \n• \nNot applicable for the residual compounds (BP > 380 °C), which will resist evaporation, persist in the \nmarine environment for longer periods, and be subject to relatively slow degradation. \nThe actual fate of released oil in the marine environment will depend greatly on the amount of oil that reaches \nthe surface, either through the initial release or by rising after discharge in the water column. \n2.3.7.2 Marine Diesel \nMarine diesel is a mixture of volatile and persistent hydrocarbons with low proportions of highly volatile and \nresidual components. In general, about 6% of the oil mass should evaporate within the first 12 hours \n(BP < 180 °C); a further 35% should evaporate within the first 24 hours (180 °C < BP < 265 °C); and a further \n54% should evaporate over several days (265 °C < BP < 380 °C). Approximately 5% of the oil is shown to be \npersistent. The aromatic content of the oil is approximately 3%. \nIf released in the marine environment and in contact with the atmosphere (i.e. surface spill), approximately \n41% by mass of this oil is predicted to evaporate over the first couple of days depending upon the prevailing \n--- Page 785 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 29 \nconditions, with further evaporation slowing over time. The heavier (low volatility) components of the oil have \na tendency to entrain into the upper water column due to wind-generated waves, but can subsequently \nresurface if wind-waves abate. Therefore, the heavier components of this oil can remain entrained or on the \nsea surface for an extended period, with associated potential for dissolution of the soluble aromatic fraction. \n2.3.8 Weathering Characteristics \n2.3.8.1 Overview \nA series of model weather tests were conducted to illustrate the potential behaviour of marine diesel when \nexposed to idealised and representative environmental conditions: \n• \nInstantaneous release (1-hour discharge) onto the water surface at a discharge rate of 50 m3/hr under \ncalm wind conditions (constant 5 knots), assuming low seasonal water temperature (27 °C) and average \nair temperature (25 °C). Slick also subject to ambient tidal and drift currents. \n• \nInstantaneous release (1-hour discharge) onto the water surface at a discharge rate of 50 m3/hr under \nvariable wind conditions (4-19 knots, drawn from representative data files), assuming low seasonal water \ntemperature (27 °C) and average air temperature (25 °C). Slick also subject to ambient tidal and drift \ncurrents. \nThe first case is indicative of cumulative weathering rates under calm conditions that would not generate \nentrainment, while the second case may represent conditions that could cause a minor degree of entrainment. \nBoth scenarios provide examples of potential behaviour during periods of a spill event, once the oil reaches \nthe surface. \n2.3.8.2 Marine Diesel \nThe mass balance forecast for the constant-wind case (Figure 2.14) for marine diesel shows that approximately \n45% of the oil is predicted to evaporate within 24 hours. Under these calm conditions the majority of the \nremaining oil on the water surface will weather at a slower rate due to being comprised of the longer-chain \ncompounds with higher boiling points. Evaporation of the residual compounds will slow significantly, and they \nwill then be subject to more gradual decay through biological and photochemical processes. \nUnder the variable-wind case (Figure 2.15), where the winds are of greater strength, entrainment of marine \ndiesel into the water column is indicated to be significant. Approximately 24 hours after the spill, around 45% \nof the oil mass is forecast to have entrained and a further 35% is forecast to have evaporated, leaving only a \nsmall proportion of the oil floating on the water surface (<1%). The residual compounds will tend to remain \nentrained beneath the surface under conditions that generate wind waves (approximately >6 m/s). \nThe increased level of entrainment in the variable-wind case will result in a higher percentage of biological and \nphotochemical degradation, where the decay of the floating slicks and oil droplets in the water column occurs \nat an approximate rate of 1.8% per day with an accumulated total of ~13% after 7 days, in comparison to a \nrate of ~0.2% per day and an accumulated total of 1.5% after 7 days in the constant-wind case. Given the \nlarge proportion of entrained oil and the tendency for it to remain mixed in the water column, the remaining \nhydrocarbons will decay and/or evaporate over time scales of several weeks to a few months. This long \nweathering duration will extend the area of potential effect, requiring the break-up and dispersion of the slicks \nand droplets to reduce concentrations below the thresholds considered in this study. \n \n \n--- Page 786 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 30 \n \nthe weathering of marine diesel spilled onto the water surface as a one-off release (50 m3 \nover 1 hour) and subject to a constant 5 kn (2.6 m/s) wind at 27 °C water temperature and \n25 °C air temperature. \n \n--- Page 787 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 31 \n \nthe weathering of marine diesel spilled onto the water surface as a one-off release (50 m3 \nover 1 hour) and subject to variable wind at 27 °C water temperature and 25 °C air \ntemperature. \n--- Page 788 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 32 \n3 \nSTOCHASTIC ASSESSMENT RESULTS \n3.1 \nOverview \nPredictions for the probability of contact and time to contact by oil concentrations equalling or exceeding \ndefined thresholds for floating oil, entrained oil and dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons are provided in the \nfollowing sections to summarise the results of the annualised stochastic modelling. \nContour maps present estimates for the annualised probability of contact by instantaneous concentrations of \nat least the defined minimum threshold concentrations (10 g/m2, 50 g/m2 and 100 g/m2 for floating oil; 100 g/m2 \nand 250 g/m2 for shoreline oil; 500 ppb for entrained oil and dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons) for at least one \ntime step. These contours summarise the outcomes for all replicate simulations commencing across the annual \nperiod – a total of 200 replicate simulations for each assessed scenario. \nReaders should note that the contour maps presented in this report do not represent the predicted coverage \nof any one hydrocarbon spill or a depiction of a slick or plume at any particular instant in time. Rather, the \ncontours are a composite of a large number of theoretical slick paths, integrated over the full duration of the \nsimulations relevant to the assessed scenario. The contour maps should be treated as indications of the \nprobability of exposure at defined concentrations, for individual locations, at some point in time after the defined \nspill commences, given the trends and variations in metocean conditions that occur around the study area. \nLocations with higher probability ratings were exposed during a greater number of spill simulations, indicating \nthat the combination of the prevailing wind and current conditions are more likely to result in contact to these \nlocations if the spill scenario were to occur in the future. The areas outside of the lowest-percentage contour \nindicate that contact will be less likely under the range of prevailing conditions for this region than areas falling \nwithin higher probability contours. It is important to note that the probabilities are derived from the samples of \ndata used in the modelling. Therefore, locations that are not calculated to receive exposure at threshold \nconcentrations or greater in any of the replicate simulations might possibly be contacted if very unusual \nconditions were to occur. Hence, we do not attribute a probability of nil to areas beyond the lowest probability \ncontour. \nthat were defined by Woodside. All sensitive receptors historically considered for Woodside spill risk \nassessments were included in the analysis, with those outlined here being the receptors shown to be at risk \nof contact for each assessed scenario. \nThe probability estimates for contact by floating oil that are presented in the tables summarise the probability \nthat oil will arrive at shorelines as floating films at the specified threshold concentration or greater for at least \none time step (1 hour). \nThe minimum time estimates shown in the tables present the shortest time for any oil to drift from the source \nto any part of the sensitive receptor, relative to the commencement of the spill. These times then indicate the \nminimum weathering time for oil that might make contact with the resource. \nThe mean and maximum shoreline concentrations indicate the concentrations forecast to potentially \naccumulate over time on any discrete part of a shoreline (calculated for individual portions of 0.8 km length). \nAccumulated concentrations are calculated by summing the mass of oil that arrives at any concentration \n(including < threshold) over time at a model cell and subtracting any mass lost through evaporation and \nwashing off, where relevant. \nThe maximum local accumulated concentration in the worst replicate spill is the greatest accumulation \npredicted for any point on the shoreline during any replicate simulation, and thus represents an extreme \n--- Page 789 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 33 \nestimate. The maximum local accumulated concentration averaged over all replicate spills is the greatest \nconcentration calculated for any point on the shoreline after averaging over all replicate simulations. \nNote that it is possible that oil films arriving at concentrations that are less than the threshold may accumulate \nover the course of a spill event to result in concentrations that apparently exceed the threshold. Hence, the \nmean expected and maximum concentrations of accumulated oil can exceed the threshold applied to the \nprobability calculations for the arrival of floating oil even where no instantaneous exceedances above threshold \nare predicted. It is important to understand that the two parameters (floating concentration and shoreline \nconcentration) are quite distinct, calculated in different ways and representative of alternative outcomes. The \nfloating probability estimates and the shoreline accumulative estimates should therefore be treated as \nindependent estimators of different exposure outcomes, and not directly compared. \nFor the entrained and dissolved components, the tabulated results summarise interrogations of cells \nrepresenting the water surrounding the sensitive receptor shorelines (or submerged features), with individual \nbuffer zones. Buffer zones were defined with consideration of the bathymetry bordering each receptor, natural \nboundaries, or sensible legislative boundaries. \nThe modelling for each assessed scenario assumed no mitigation efforts are undertaken to collect or otherwise \naffect the natural transport and weathering of the oil. \nThe predicted outcomes based on the modelling results are discussed in the following sections in terms of \nfloating, entrained and dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons. Discussion is based around the outcomes of \nstochastic risk contours. Plots of the Zones of Consequence (ZoCs) and minimum time to exceedance of \nconcentration thresholds are presented for the assessed thresholds. \ndissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in the water column were extracted for each assessed \nscenario. \n \n--- Page 790 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 34 \n \nLocations of cross-sections, over a varying latitude (dashed line) and longitude (solid line), along which the distributions of maximum \nentrained oil and dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were extracted for each spill scenario in this study.\n--- Page 791 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 35 \n3.2 \nScenario 1: Short-Term (Instantaneous) Surface Release \nof Marine Diesel after a Vessel Collision outside Mermaid \nSound \n3.2.1 Discussion of Results \n3.2.1.1 Overview \nThis scenario investigated the probability of exposure to surrounding regions by oil resulting from a short-term \n(instantaneous) surface release of 2,000 m3 of marine diesel outside Mermaid Sound during operations at any \ntime of year, with no mitigation measures applied. \nConsidering the discharge characteristics, the properties of the oil and its expected weathering behaviour, \nfloating oil will be susceptible to entrainment into the wave-mixed layer under typical wind conditions. \nEvaporation rates will be significant, given the moderate proportion of volatile compounds in the oil (41%). The \nlow-volatility fraction of the oil (54%) will take longer durations of the order of days to evaporate, and the \nresidual fraction of 5% is expected to persist in the environment until degradation processes occur. Considering \nthe spill volume, there is a low potential for dissolution of soluble aromatic compounds. \n3.2.1.2 Floating and Shoreline Oil \nThe probability contour figures for floating oil indicate that concentrations equal to or greater than the 10 g/m2, \n50 g/m2 and 100 g/m2 thresholds could potentially be found, in the form of slicks, up to 29 km, 21 km and \n18 km from the spill site, respectively (Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4). \nThe Dampier Archipelago shoreline receptor is predicted to be contacted by floating oil concentrations at the \n10 g/m2 threshold with a probability of 2% and a minimum time to contact of 27 hours (Table 3.1). Probabilities \nof floating oil contact at the 50 g/m2 and 100 g/m2 thresholds are forecast to be equal to or less than 1% for \nother shoreline receptors. \nPotential for accumulation of oil on shorelines is predicted to be low, with a maximum accumulated volume of \n3 m3 and a maximum local accumulated concentration on shorelines of 156 g/m2 forecast at the Dampier \nArchipelago (Table 3.1). \nThe forecast annualised minimum times to contact, ZoC and smoothed ZoC for floating oil at or above the \n10 g/m2, 50 g/m2 and 100 g/m2 threshold concentrations are depicted in Figure 3.5 to Figure 3.7, Figure 3.8 to \n3.2.1.3 Entrained Oil \nEntrained oil at concentrations equal to or greater than the 500 ppb threshold is predicted to be found up to \naround 163 km from the spill site (Figure 3.15). \nThe Dampier MP and Dampier Archipelago receptors are predicted to receive entrained oil concentrations at \nthe 500 ppb threshold with probabilities of 44% and 23%, respectively (Table 3.2). The maximum entrained oil \nconcentration is forecast as 10.9 ppm within the Dampier Archipelago. \nThe forecast annualised minimum times to contact, ZoC and smoothed ZoC for entrained oil at or above the \n500 ppb threshold concentration are depicted in Figure 3.16, Figure 3.17 and Figure 3.18, respectively. \nThe cross-sectional transects of maximum entrained oil concentrations in the vicinity of the release site show \nthat concentrations above 25,000 ppb are expected to extend from the sea surface to depths of around 20 m \n(Figure 3.19). \n--- Page 792 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 36 \n3.2.1.4 Dissolved Aromatic Hydrocarbons \nDissolved aromatic hydrocarbons at concentrations equal to or greater than the 500 ppb threshold are \npredicted to be found up to around 34 km from the spill site (Figure 3.20). \nThe Dampier MP receptor is predicted to receive dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations at the \n500 ppb threshold with a probability of 2% (Table 3.3).

The \nlow-volatility fraction of the oil (54%) will take longer durations of the order of days to evaporate, and the \nresidual fraction of 5% is expected to persist in the environment until degradation processes occur. Considering \nthe spill volume, there is a low potential for dissolution of soluble aromatic compounds. \n3.3.1.2 Floating and Shoreline Oil \nThe probability contour figures for floating oil indicate that concentrations equal to or greater than the 10 g/m2, \n50 g/m2 and 100 g/m2 thresholds could potentially be found, in the form of slicks, up to 39 km, 36 km and \n33 km from the spill site, respectively (Figure 3.25, Figure 3.26 and Figure 3.27). \nGiven that the spill location lies within the Montebello MP receptor area, floating oil at concentrations equal to \nor greater than 100 g/m2 are forecast with a probability of 100% and a minimum time to contact of less than \n1 hour (Table 3.4). Probabilities of floating oil contact at the 10 g/m2 threshold are forecast to be less than 1% \nfor all other shoreline receptors. \nPotential for accumulation of oil on shorelines is predicted to be low, with a maximum accumulated volume of \n<1 m3 and a maximum local accumulated concentration on shorelines of 11 g/m2 forecast at Barrow Island \n(Table 3.4). \nThe forecast annualised minimum times to contact, ZoC and smoothed ZoC for floating oil at or above the \n10 g/m2, 50 g/m2 and 100 g/m2 threshold concentrations are depicted in Figure 3.28 to Figure 3.30, Figure \n3.31 to Figure 3.33 and Figure 3.34 to Figure 3.36, respectively. \n3.3.1.3 Entrained Oil \nEntrained oil at concentrations equal to or greater than the 500 ppb threshold is predicted to be found up to \naround 308 km from the spill site (Figure 3.37). \nThe Montebello MP and Muiron Islands MMA-WHA receptors are predicted to receive entrained oil \nconcentrations at the 500 ppb threshold with probabilities of 70% and 7%, respectively (Table 3.5). The \nmaximum entrained oil concentration is forecast as 157.0 ppm within the Montebello MP. \nThe forecast annualised minimum times to contact, ZoC and smoothed ZoC for entrained oil at or above the \n500 ppb threshold concentration are depicted in Figure 3.38, Figure 3.39 and Figure 3.40, respectively. \nThe cross-sectional transects of maximum entrained oil concentrations in the vicinity of the release site show \nthat concentrations above 25,000 ppb are expected to extend from the sea surface to depths of around 15 m \n(Figure 3.41). \n--- Page 820 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 64 \n3.3.1.4 Dissolved Aromatic Hydrocarbons \nDissolved aromatic hydrocarbons at concentrations equal to or greater than the 500 ppb threshold are \npredicted to be found up to around 85 km from the spill site (Figure 3.42). \nThe Montebello MP receptor is predicted to receive dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations at the \n500 ppb threshold with a probability of 9% (Table 3.6). The maximum dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon \nconcentration is forecast as 2.0 ppm within the Montebello MP. \nThe forecast annualised minimum times to contact, ZoC and smoothed ZoC for dissolved aromatic \nhydrocarbons at or above the 500 ppb threshold concentration are depicted in Figure 3.43, Figure 3.44 and \nThe cross-sectional transects of maximum dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in the vicinity of the \nrelease site show that concentrations above 1,000 ppb are expected to extend from the sea surface to depths \nof around 15 m (Figure 3.46). \n \n--- Page 821 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 65 \n3.3.2 Results Tables and Figures \n3.3.2.1 Floating and Shoreline Oil \nExpected annualised floating and shoreline oil outcomes at sensitive receptors resulting from an instantaneous surface release of marine diesel after a vessel collision within Montebello Marine Park. \nReceptor \nProbability (%) \nof floating oil \nconcentration \n≥10 g/m2 \nProbability (%) \nof floating oil \nconcentration \n≥50 g/m2 \nProbability (%) \nof floating oil \nconcentration \n≥100 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nfloating oil at \n≥10 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nfloating oil at \n≥50 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nfloating oil at \n≥100 g/m2 \nProbability (%) \nof shoreline oil \nconcentration \n≥100 g/m2 \nProbability (%) \nof shoreline oil \nconcentration \n≥250 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nshoreline oil at \n≥100 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nshoreline oil at \n≥250 g/m2 \nMaximum local \naccumulated \nconcentration \n(g/m2) averaged \nover all \nreplicate \nsimulations \nMaximum local \naccumulated \nconcentration \n(g/m2) in the \nworst replicate \nsimulation \nMaximum \naccumulated \nvolume (m3) \nalong this \nshoreline, \naveraged over \nall replicate \nsimulations \nMaximum \naccumulated \nvolume (m3) \nalong this \nshoreline, in the \nworst replicate \nsimulation \nArgo-Rowley Terrace MP* \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nBarrow Island \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \n0.1 \n11 \n<1 \n<1 \nGlomar Shoals* \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nMontebello Islands \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \n<0.1 \n4.1 \n<1 \n<1 \nMuiron Islands MMA-WHA \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \n<0.1 \n7.1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNingaloo Coast Middle \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNingaloo Coast Middle WHA \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNingaloo Coast North \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \n<0.1 \n7 \n<1 \n<1 \nNingaloo Coast North WHA \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \n<0.1 \n7 \n<1 \n<1 \nNingaloo Coast South WHA \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNingaloo RUZ* \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nPilbara Islands - Southern Island \nGroup \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \n<0.1 \n1.7 \n<1 \n<1 \nRankin Bank* \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nShark Bay Open Ocean Coast \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nShark Bay WHA \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nBernier & Dorre Islands \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nLowendal Islands \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nMontebello MP* \n100 \n100 \n100 \n1 \n1 \n1 \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nMontebello State Marine Park \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \n<0.1 \n4.1 \n<1 \n<1 \nMuiron Islands \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \n<0.1 \n7.1 \n<1 \n<1 \nGascoyne MP* \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nWA Coastline \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \n0.1 \n11 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC: No contact to receptor predicted for specified threshold.

The \nlow-volatility fraction of the oil (54%) will take longer durations of the order of days to evaporate, and the \nresidual fraction of 5% is expected to persist in the environment until degradation processes occur. Considering \nthe spill volume, there is a low potential for dissolution of soluble aromatic compounds. \n3.4.1.2 Floating and Shoreline Oil \nThe probability contour figures for floating oil indicate that concentrations equal to or greater than the 10 g/m2, \n50 g/m2 and 100 g/m2 thresholds could potentially be found, in the form of slicks, up to 113 km, 60 km and \n58 km from the spill site, respectively (Figure 3.47, Figure 3.48 and Figure 3.49). \nNo shoreline receptors are predicted to be contacted by floating oil concentrations at any of the assessed \nthresholds (Table 3.7). Floating oil at the 10 g/m2 threshold is predicted to arrive at the surface waters of the \nGascoyne MP receptor with a probability of 1% after 64 hours. \nNo accumulation of oil on shorelines is predicted (Table 3.7). \nThe forecast annualised minimum times to contact, ZoC and smoothed ZoC for floating oil at or above the \n10 g/m2, 50 g/m2 and 100 g/m2 threshold concentrations are depicted in Figure 3.50 to Figure 3.52, Figure \n3.53 to Figure 3.55 and Figure 3.56 to Figure 3.58, respectively. \n3.4.1.3 Entrained Oil \nEntrained oil at concentrations equal to or greater than the 500 ppb threshold is predicted to be found up to \naround 476 km from the spill site (Figure 3.59). \nThe Gascoyne MP is predicted to receive entrained oil concentrations at the 500 ppb threshold with a \nprobability of 8% (Table 3.8). The maximum entrained oil concentration is forecast as 7.2 ppm within the \nGascoyne MP. \nThe forecast annualised minimum times to contact, ZoC and smoothed ZoC for entrained oil at or above the \n500 ppb threshold concentration are depicted in Figure 3.60, Figure 3.61 and Figure 3.62, respectively. \nThe cross-sectional transects of maximum entrained oil concentrations in the vicinity of the release site show \nthat concentrations above 25,000 ppb are expected to extend from the sea surface to depths of around 15 m \n(Figure 3.63). \n--- Page 847 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 91 \n3.4.1.4 Dissolved Aromatic Hydrocarbons \nDissolved aromatic hydrocarbons at concentrations equal to or greater than the 500 ppb threshold are \npredicted to be found up to around 74 km from the spill site (Figure 3.64). \nNo receptors are predicted to receive dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations at the 500 ppb threshold \n(Table 3.9). The maximum dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentration is forecast as 462 ppb within the \nGascoyne MP. \nThe forecast annualised minimum times to contact, ZoC and smoothed ZoC for dissolved aromatic \nhydrocarbons at or above the 500 ppb threshold concentration are depicted in Figure 3.65, Figure 3.66 and \nThe cross-sectional transects of maximum dissolved aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in the vicinity of the \nrelease site show that concentrations above 1,000 ppb are expected to extend from the sea surface to depths \nof around 15 m (Figure 3.68). \n \n--- Page 848 ---\nREPORT \nMAW0764J  |  Woodside Scarborough Project – Quantitative Spill Risk Assessment  |  Rev 1  |  17 April 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 92 \n3.4.2 Results Tables and Figures \n3.4.2.1 Floating and Shoreline Oil \nExpected annualised floating and shoreline oil outcomes at sensitive receptors resulting from an instantaneous surface release of marine diesel after a vessel collision at the FPU location. \nReceptor \nProbability (%) \nof floating oil \nconcentration \n≥10 g/m2 \nProbability (%) \nof floating oil \nconcentration \n≥50 g/m2 \nProbability (%) \nof floating oil \nconcentration \n≥100 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nfloating oil at \n≥10 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nfloating oil at \n≥50 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nfloating oil at \n≥100 g/m2 \nProbability (%) \nof shoreline oil \nconcentration \n≥100 g/m2 \nProbability (%) \nof shoreline oil \nconcentration \n≥250 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nshoreline oil at \n≥100 g/m2 \nMinimum time \nto receptor \n(hours) for \nshoreline oil at \n≥250 g/m2 \nMaximum local \naccumulated \nconcentration \n(g/m2) averaged \nover all \nreplicate \nsimulations \nMaximum local \naccumulated \nconcentration \n(g/m2) in the \nworst replicate \nsimulation \nMaximum \naccumulated \nvolume (m3) \nalong this \nshoreline, \naveraged over \nall replicate \nsimulations \nMaximum \naccumulated \nvolume (m3) \nalong this \nshoreline, in the \nworst replicate \nsimulation \nNingaloo Coast North WHA \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNingaloo RUZ* \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nAbrolhos Islands MP* \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nCarnarvon Canyon MP* \n<1 \n<1 \n<1 \nNC \nNC \nNC \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nGascoyne MP* \n1 \n<1 \n<1 \n64 \nNC \nNC \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNC: No contact to receptor predicted for specified threshold.

2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 124 \n5 \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe main findings of this study are as follows: \nMetocean Influences \n• \nTidal flows will have a significant influence on the trajectory of any oil spilled at the modelled release sites, \nirrespective of the seasonal conditions. \n• \nLarge-scale drift currents will have a significant influence on the trajectory of any oil spilled at the modelled \nrelease sites, irrespective of the seasonal conditions. The prevailing drift currents will determine the \ntrajectory of oil that is entrained beneath the water surface. \n• \nInteractions with the prevailing wind will provide additional variation in the trajectory of spilled oil. \n• \nDue to the location of the hypothetical spill site and the dominance of tidal flows, the coastal areas \npredicted to be most likely to be impacted by spilled oil are those bordering Mermaid Sound and its \nnumerous passages. \nOil Characteristics and Weathering Behaviour \n• \nMarine diesel is a mixture of volatile and persistent hydrocarbons with low percentages of highly volatile \nand residual components. If exposed to the atmosphere, around 41% of the mass would be expected to \nevaporate in around 24 hours, another 54% within a few days, and the remaining 5% would be expected \nto persist in the marine environment until decayed. The influence of entrainment will regulate the degree \nof mass retention in the environment. \n• \nDuring the surface release, floating oil will be susceptible to entrainment into the wave-mixed layer under \ntypical wind conditions. Evaporation rates will be significant, given the moderate proportion of volatile \ncompounds in the oil (41%). The low-volatility fraction of the oil (54%) will take longer durations of the \norder of days to evaporate, and the residual fraction of 5% is expected to persist in the environment until \ndegradation processes occur. Considering the spill volume, there is a low potential for dissolution of \nsoluble aromatic compounds. \nSummary of Stochastic Assessment Results \nScenario 1: Short-Term (Instantaneous) Surface Release of Marine \nDiesel after a Vessel Collision outside Mermaid Sound \n• \nFloating oil at concentrations equal to or greater than the 10 g/m2, 50 g/m2 and 100 g/m2 thresholds could \npotentially

The Scarborough gas field is located within offshore permit WA-1-R. \nDredging, disposal and backfill operations along the Scarborough pipeline route, from the mainland of the \nBurrup Peninsula outwards to a chainage of KP50, are proposed as part of the project (Figure 1.1). \nRPS has conducted sediment dispersion modelling to quantify the potential magnitude, intensity and spatial \ndistribution of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and sedimentation that would be expected for the \ndredging, disposal and backfill operations proposed for the development of Scarborough.

A pontoon equipped with a hydraulic excavator. The pontoon is stabilised and secured by \nthree spuds. The excavator uses a large arm fitted with a bucket to excavate material from the seabed and \ndischarge it into (typically) a split hopper barge moored alongside.

A hydrodynamic and wave model framework for the Mermaid Sound \narea was constructed, calibrated and validated for a past marine modelling study of dredge spoil stability and \nnavigation for Woodside (RPS, 2016). This model framework has been refined for the Scarborough scope of \nwork and is described in the following sections. \nThe hydrodynamic and wave modelling for the project was conducted using the Delft3D suite of software. The \nDelft3D suite is a fully integrated computer software package composed of several modules (e.g. flow, waves, \nsediment, water quality, and ecology) grouped around a common interface. This software suite has been \ndeveloped to carry out studies with a multi-disciplinary approach and multi-dimensional calculations (e.g. 2-D \nand 3-D) for a range of systems, such as oceanic, coastal, estuarine and river environments. It can simulate \nthe interaction of flows, waves, sediment transport, morphological developments, water quality and aquatic \necology. Specific modules of the Delft3D suite are referenced in this report, following the convention of the \nsoftware developers, with the suffix D- (e.g. D-FLOW for the Delft3D Hydrodynamics module and D-WAVE for \nthe Delft3D Spectral Wave module). \nThe Delft3D suite has been developed by Deltares, an independent institute for applied research on water with \nover 30 years of experience in modelling aquatic systems (http://www.deltares.nl/en). The Delft3D suite of \nmodels adheres to the International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research guidelines \nfor documenting the validity of computational modelling software, closely replicating an array of analytical, \nlaboratory, schematic and real-world data. \nThe configuration of the current and wave models is in line with recommendations of best practice for sediment \ndispersion modelling in Western Australia as outlined by WAMSI Dredging Science Node guidance (Sun et al., \n2016). Inclusion of mesoscale ocean currents is recommended, as these currents have a significant influence \non the net drift of suspended material over the time scales of dredging operations (days to weeks) and are \ntherefore important to predictions of sediment transport. The use of three-dimensional current modelling with \na series of interconnected grids of progressively finer resolution is also recommended, as are coupling of the \ncurrent and wave models and validation of current predictions against measured data. \n2.2 \nHydrodynamic Model (D-FLOW) \n2.2.1 Model Description \nTo simulate the hydrodynamics within Mermaid Sound and the surrounding area, a three-dimensional model \nwith accurate representations of the bathymetry, bottom roughness and spatially-varying wind stress was \nutilised for the region. The model framework was developed through the combination of a large-scale regional \nmodel with smaller refined regions, or sub-domains. \nThe D-FLOW model is ideally suited to represent the hydrodynamics of complex coastal waters, including \nregions where the tidal range creates large intertidal zones and where buoyancy processes are important. \nRPS has applied the model for numerous studies in the region. \nD-FLOW is a multi-dimensional (2-D or 3-D) hydrodynamic (and transport) simulation program which \ncalculates non-steady flow and transport phenomena that result from tidal, meteorological and baroclinic \nforcing on a rectilinear or a curvilinear, boundary-fitted grid. In three-dimensional simulations, the vertical grid \n--- Page 902 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 6 \ncan be defined following the sigma-coordinate approach, where the local water depth is divided into a series \nof layers with thickness at a set proportion of the depth. \nD-FLOW allows for the establishment of a series of interconnected (two-way, dynamically-nested) curvilinear \ngrids of varying resolution; a technique referred to as “domain decomposition”. This allows for the generation \nof a series of grids with progressively increasing spatial resolution, down to an appropriate scale for accurate \nresolution of the hydrodynamics associated with features such as dredged channels. The main advantage of \ndomain decomposition over traditional one-way, or static, nesting systems is that the model domains interact \nseamlessly, allowing transport and feedback between the regions of different scales. The ability to dynamically \ncouple multiple model domains offers a flexible framework for hydrodynamic model development. This \nmodelling method was applied in this study. \nInputs to the model, as discussed in the following sections, included: \n• \nBathymetry of the study area, including shipping channels, islands, and adjacent features. The wetting \nand drying of the intertidal zones was simulated in applicable areas. \n• \nBoundary elevation forcing data. \n• \nSpatially-varying surface wind and pressure data. \n2.2.2 Bathymetry and Domain Definition \nThe hydrodynamic model was established over the domain shown in Figure 2.1. Accurate bathymetry is a \nsignificant factor in development of a model framework required to resolve highly variable wave and current \nconditions. The bathymetry was developed using data provided by Woodside and supplemented with data \nfrom Geoscience Australia and the C-MAP electronic chart database where relevant and required. \nThe composite bathymetric data was interpolated onto the D-FLOW Cartesian grid. The resultant bathymetry \nis shown in Figure 2.2. The extent and shape of the model coastline will change as water levels rise and fall \nwith tidal movements due to the inclusion of wetting and drying within the model system. \nThe vertical grid of the model comprised five layers of varying thickness, depending on location, throughout \nthe domain. Five layers was found to be enough to resolve the circulation and provide suitable bed level \ncurrents, without overly compromising model performance. As the model was set up as a proportional sigma-\ngrid in the vertical dimension, these layers therefore represented a terrain-following arrangement with a layer \nthickness of 20% of the total local water depth. \nTo offset the computational effort required for a large, multi-layered model domain, and to achieve adequate \nhorizontal and temporal resolution, a multiple-grid (domain-decomposition) strategy was applied using three \nsub-domains of varying horizontal grid cell size (Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2). Horizontal resolutions within each \nsub-domain were 250 m for the Mermaid Sound region from Enderby Island to Legendre Island (sub-grid 2), \n500 m for the intermediate region (sub-grid 1) and 2 km for the outer domain (sub-grid 0). \nEach sub-domain is an individual hydrodynamic model simulated in parallel with the others, with dynamic \ncoupling at the shared boundaries between sub-domains. The outermost sub-domain captured large-scale \noceanographic phenomena which progressively fed into the finer-resolution domains representing the area of \ninterest. The resolution of the innermost sub-domain was specified after assessment of the requirement to \nadequately resolve the variation in current fields, and in turn the sediment dynamics. \n \n--- Page 903 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 7 \n \n \n \nModel grid setup showing the domain-decomposition scheme applied, highlighting the two outermost grids. \n \n--- Page 904 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 8 \n \n \n \nModel grid setup showing the domain-decomposition scheme applied, highlighting the innermost grid.\n--- Page 905 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 9 \n2.2.3 Boundary and Initial Conditions \n2.2.3.1 Overview \nAs the hydrodynamics in the study area are controlled primarily by tidal flows and wind forcing, these processes \nwere explicitly included in the developed model. \nThe model was forced on the open boundaries of the outer sub-domain with time series of water elevation \nobtained for the chosen simulation period. Spatially-varying wind speed and wind direction data was used to \nforce the model across the entire domain. \n2.2.3.2 Water Elevation \nWater elevations at hourly intervals were obtained from the TPXO8.0 database, which is the most recent \niteration of a global model of ocean tides derived from measurements of sea-surface topography by the \nTOPEX/Poseidon satellite-borne radar altimeters. Tides are provided as complex amplitudes of earth-relative \nsea-surface elevation for eight primary (M2, S2, N2, K2, K1, O1, P1, Q1), two long-period (Mf, Mm) and three non-\nlinear (M4, MS4, MN4) harmonic constituents at a spatial resolution of 0.25°. \nThe tidal sea level data was augmented with non-tidal sea level elevation data from the global Hybrid \nCoordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM; Bleck, 2002; Chassignet et al., 2003; Halliwell, 2004), created by the \nUSA’s National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) as part of the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment \n(GODAE). The HYCOM model is a three-dimensional model that assimilates observations of sea surface \ntemperature, sea surface salinity and surface height, obtained by satellite instrumentation, along with \natmospheric forcing conditions from atmospheric models to predict drift currents generated by such forces as \nwind shear, density, sea height variations and the rotation of the Earth. \nThe HYCOM model is configured to combine the three vertical coordinate types currently in use in ocean \nmodels: depth (z-levels), density (isopycnal layers), and terrain-following (σ-levels). HYCOM uses isopycnal \nlayers in the open, stratified ocean, but uses the layered continuity equation to make a dynamically smooth \ntransition to a terrain-following coordinate in shallow coastal regions, and to z-level coordinates in the mixed \nlayer and/or unstratified seas. Thus, this hybrid coordinate system allows for the extension of the geographic \nrange of applicability to shallow coastal seas and unstratified parts of the world ocean. It maintains the \nsignificant advantages of an isopycnal model in stratified regions while allowing more vertical resolution near \nthe surface and in shallow coastal areas, hence providing a better representation of the upper ocean physics \nthan non-hybrid models. The model has global coverage with a horizontal resolution of 1/12th of a degree \n(~7 km at mid-latitudes) and a temporal resolution of 24 hours. \n2.2.3.3 Wind Forcing \nSpatially-variable wind data was sourced from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS), which is used by \nthe National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) model to place \nobservations into a gridded model space for the purpose of starting, or initializing, weather forecasts with \nobserved data. The GFS Forecasts model variant used has a horizontal resolution of 1/12th of a degree and a \ntemporal resolution of 6 hours (NCEP, 2016). \n2.2.4 Model Validation \n2.2.4.1 Comparison of Modelled and Measured Water Elevation \nValidation of the water level changes predicted by the D-FLOW hydrodynamic model configuration was \nprovided through comparisons to independent predictions from the XTide tidal constituent database (Flater, \n--- Page 906 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 10 \n1998). Comparison of model tidal amplitudes with the XTide database showed strong agreement (Figure 2.3), \nwith slight overprediction of tidal amplitudes at some stations. Time series comparisons for two tide stations \nsituated at locations that are relevant to this study also showed good agreement (Figure 2.4). \nIn general, a consistent match is observed between water elevations calculated by the D-FLOW model and \nthose predicted by XTide (Figure 2.4). Both the amplitude and phase of the semidiurnal tidal signal are clearly \nreproduced at each station, as is the timing of the spring-neap cycle. The D-FLOW model slightly overpredicts \nhigh tides and underpredicts low tides, which indicates there was a small difference between the datums used \nto compare these different data sets rather than actual amplitude differences. \n \n \nComparison of tidal amplitudes from the D-FLOW hydrodynamic model (y-axis) with those \nfrom the XTide database (x-axis) at 14 stations located within the model domain. \n \n--- Page 907 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 11 \n \n \n \n \nComparisons of water elevations predicted by the D-FLOW hydrodynamic model (blue line) with those predicted by the XTide database \n(green line) over the validation period of October-November 2010 at two selected station locations. \n \n--- Page 908 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 12 \n2.2.4.2 Comparison of Modelled and Measured Currents \nValidation of the model-predicted currents was conducted for a spring/neap tide period during October and \nNovember 2010 by comparing the model results to measured data from the Woodside LNG Channel AWAC \nthat was located within Mermaid Sound (116.738° E, 20.561° S) in water depth of approximately 12 m. \nComparisons of current speed and direction at a depth interval representative of the mid-water column are \nprovided in Figure 2.5. \nOverall, the comparison indicates that the model provides a good prediction of tidal currents at the comparison \nsite. There was a minor mismatch in the phase of the tidal oscillations, with a slight lag apparent in the modelled \ndata. However, this lag was not evident in the XTide water level comparisons (Figure 2.4). \nThe amplitudes of the modelled and measured current fluctuations were generally well-matched, but there \nwere some spikes in the measured data that were not reproduced. These spikes in the measured data, \nassuming they were not instrument errors, may have been caused by local-scale events related to wind-driven \ncurrents. These events are difficult to reproduce in the model because the horizontal grid scale of the model \nin this region is 250 m. The GFS wind driving the model can be less accurate close to the coast when sea \nbreeze effects are dominant. The inability of the model to reproduce some spikes observed in the measured \ndata might be explained by inaccuracies in the NCEP wind data near to the Woodside LNG Channel AWAC \nlocation. \n \n \n--- Page 909 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 13 \n \nComparisons of modelled (blue line) and measured (green line) currents for a mid-water \ncolumn depth interval at the Woodside LNG Channel AWAC location during the 2010 \nvalidation period. \n \n--- Page 910 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 14 \n2.3 \nWave Model (D-WAVE) \n2.3.1 Model Description \nReliable forecasting for the fate of fine sediments in the study location, which is a wave-exposed coastal region, \nrequired the input of wave spectra information to calculate the shear-stress and orbital velocities imposed by \nwaves which will affect the settlement and re-suspension of fine material that is initially suspended by dredging \nand related operations. D-WAVE is a variant of the well-known SWAN wave model that has been customised \nfor compatibility with the Delft3D software suite. \nThe D-WAVE model is a spectral phase-averaging wave model originally developed by the Delft University of \nTechnology. D-WAVE, a third-generation model based on the energy balance equation, is a numerical model \nfor simulating realistic estimates of wave parameters in coastal areas for given wind, bottom and current \nconditions. \nD-WAVE includes algorithms for the following wave propagation processes: propagation through geographic \nspace; refraction and shoaling due to bottom and current variations; blocking and reflections by opposing \ncurrents; and transmission through or blockage by obstacles. The model also accounts for dissipation effects \ndue to white-capping, bottom friction and wave breaking as well as non-linear wave-wave interactions. D-\nWAVE is fully spectral (in all directions and frequencies) and computes the evolution of wind waves in coastal \nregions with shallow water depths and ambient currents. \nRPS has successfully applied D-WAVE in many studies in the region, including ambient condition modelling \nin Mermaid Sound and dredging fate projects in the wider Pilbara region. \n2.3.2 Model Implementation \nThe D-WAVE model was developed to cover the same grid regions defined by the hydrodynamic model (Figure \n2.1 and Figure 2.2). The bathymetry and wind data input to the wave model was the same as used for the \nhydrodynamic model. Time-varying water level information for each grid node in the wave model was provided \nby the output of the hydrodynamic model. The boundary data to represent swells imposed from a distance was \nsourced from the WAVEWATCH III 0.5° model, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) (NOAA, 2018). \nThe wave model was run in a coupled mode with the hydrodynamic model for the years of 2016 and 2017. \nThe model results were independently validated by comparison to other modelled wave data for the Mermaid \nSound region that is held internally by RPS. \n \n--- Page 911 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 15 \n3 \nSEDIMENT FATE MODELLING \n3.1 \nGeneral Approach \nEstimates for the three-dimensional distribution of sediments suspended by dredging, disposal and backfill \noperations have been derived for the full duration of the pipeline dredging and backfill program using numerical \nmodelling. The approach of modelling dredging operations in full and in three dimensions is in line with best \npractice for sediment dispersion modelling in Western Australia as outlined by WAMSI Dredging Science Node \nguidance (Sun et al., 2016). \nThis modelling relied upon specification of sediment discharges over time for each of the expected sources of \nsediment suspension, and predicted the evolution of the combined sediment plumes via current transport, \ndispersion, sinking and sedimentation. The model allowed for the subsequent resuspension of settling \nsediments due to the erosive effects of currents and waves. Thus, the fate of sediments was assessed beyond \ntheir initial settling. \nForcing was provided using predictions of three-dimensional current fields and two-dimensional wave fields \nfor the study area, which are described in Section 2. \n3.2 \nModel Description \nModelling of the dispersion of suspended sediment resulting from the various dredging, disposal and backfill \noperations was undertaken using an advanced sediment fate model, Suspended Sediment FATE (SSFATE), \noperating within the RPS DREDGEMAP model framework. This model computes the advection, dispersion, \ndifferential sinking, settlement and resuspension of sediment particles. The model can be used to represent \ninputs from a wide range of suspension sources, producing predictions of sediment fate both over the short-\nterm (minutes to days following a discharge source) and longer term (days to years following a discharge \nsource). \nSSFATE allows the three-dimensional predictions of SSC and seabed sedimentation to be assessed against \nallowable exposure thresholds. Sedimentation thresholds often relate to burial depths or rates, while SSC \nthresholds are usually more complicated, involving tiered exposure duration and intensities. As a result, \nassessing the project-generated sediment distributions against these thresholds in both three-dimensional \nspace and time is a computationally intensive task. A variety of SSC threshold formulations have recently been \napplied in Western Australian coastal waters and at present there are no general guidelines. \nSSFATE is a computer model originally developed jointly by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nEngineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and RPS to estimate SSC generated in the water \ncolumn and deposition patterns generated due to dredging operations in a current-dominated environment, \nsuch as a river (Johnson et al., 2000; Swanson et al., 2000, 2004). RPS has significantly enhanced the \ncapability of SSFATE to allow the prediction of sediment fate in marine and coastal environments where wave \nforcing becomes important for reworking the distribution of sediments (Swanson et al., 2007). \nSSFATE is formulated to simulate far-field effects (~25 m or larger scale) in which the mean transport and \nturbulence associated with ambient currents are dominant over the initial turbulence generated at the \ndischarge point. A five-class particle-based model predicts the transport and dispersion of the suspended \nmaterial. The classes include the 0-130 µm range of sediment grain sizes that typically result in plumes. \nHeavier sediments tend to settle very rapidly, remain more stable over time and are not relevant over the \nlonger durations (>1 hour) and larger spatial scales (>25 m) of interest here. Table 3.1 shows the standard \nmaterial classes used in SSFATE for suspended sediment. \n \n \n--- Page 912 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 16 \nMaterial size classes used in SSFATE. \nMaterial Class Description \nParticle Size Range (µm) \nClay \n<7 \nFine Silt \n8-34 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n \nParticle advection is calculated using three-dimensional current fields, obtained from hydrodynamic modelling, \nthus the model can account for vertical changes in the currents within the water column. For example, as \nparticles sink towards the seabed they will tend to be moved at slower speeds due to the slowing of currents \nby friction at the seabed. Particle diffusion is assumed to follow a random walk process using a Lagrangian \napproach of calculating transport, which uses a grid-less space to remove limitations of grid resolution, \nartefacts due to grid boundaries, and also maintain a high degree of mass conservation. \nFollowing release into the model space, the sediment cloud evolves according to the following processes: \n• \nAdvection due to the three-dimensional current field. \n• \nDiffusion by a random walk model with the mass diffusion rate specified, ideally, from measurements at \nthe site. As particles represent an ensemble of real particles, each particle in the model has an associated \nGaussian distribution governed by particle age and the mass diffusion properties of the surrounding water. \n• \nSettlement or sinking of the sediment due to buoyancy forces. Settlement rates are determined from the \nparticle class sizes and include allowance for flocculation and other concentration-dependent behaviour, \nfollowing the model of Teeter (2000). \n• \nPotential deposition to the seabed determined using a model that couples the deposition across particle \nclasses (Teeter, 2000). The likelihood and rate of deposition depends on the shear stress at the seabed. \nHigh shear inhibits deposition, and in some cases excludes it altogether with sediment remaining in \nsuspension. The model allows for partial deposition of individual particles according to a practical \ndeposition rate, thereby allowing the bulk sediment mass to be represented by fewer particles. \n• \nPotential resuspension from the seabed, if previously deposited, at a rate governed by exceedance of a \nshear stress threshold at the seabed due to the combined action of waves and currents. Different \nthresholds are applied for resuspension depending upon the size of the particle and the duration of \nsedimentation, based on empirical studies that have demonstrated that newly-settled sediments will have \nhigher water content and are more easily resuspended by lower shear stresses (Swanson et al., 2007). \nThe resuspension flux calculation also accounts for armouring of fine particles within the interstitial spaces \nof larger particles. Thus, the model can indicate whether deposits will stabilise or continue to erode over \ntime given the shear forces that occur at the site. Resuspended material is released back into the water \ncolumn to be affected by the processes defined above. \nSSFATE formulations and proof of performance have been documented in a series of USACE Dredging \nOperations and Environmental Research (DOER) Program technical notes (Johnson et al., 2000; Swanson et \nal., 2000), and published in the peer-reviewed literature (Andersen et al., 2001; Swanson et al., 2004; Swanson \net al., 2007). SSFATE has been applied and validated by RPS against observations of sedimentation and \nsuspended sediments at multiple locations in Australia, notably Cockburn Sound for Fremantle Ports and \nMermaid Sound for the LNG Foundation Project dredging program. \n--- Page 913 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 17 \n3.3 \nModel Limitations \nThere are inherent limitations to the accuracy of numerical models. The possible sources of uncertainty within \nthe modelling conducted for the sediment fate assessment of the Scarborough development include: \n• \nThe equations and algorithms applied in the model. The formulations included in the model, as discussed \nin Section 3.2, were selected to achieve the best possible representation of the relevant processes and \nhave been proven to be valid over a range of projects. \n• \nThe accuracy of the physical (current and wave) inputs to the model. Current and wave forcing inputs \nwere provided from validated three-dimensional hydrodynamic and wave models created and customised \nfor the study area. The accuracy of these models is suitable, as good correlations with field measurements \nand independent model predictions have been achieved, with the uncertainties minimised and \nquantifiable. The hydrodynamic and wave models are described in Section 2. It should be noted that the \nmodel inputs are a hindcast of past metocean conditions; the overall trends reflected in this data will be \nbroadly reflected in future conditions, but conditions on any given day during the actual dredging \noperations may be quite different. \n• \nThe accuracy of dredge methodology inputs to the model. Specification of the proposed dredge and \ndisposal methodologies was provided by Woodside after consultation with the dredging contractors that \nmay be engaged to perform the work. Any assumptions made to achieve a realistic representation of the \ndredging and disposal activities are outlined in Section 3.5 and were based on extensive past project \nexperience. \n• \nThe accuracy of the material properties input to the model. Geotechnical information obtained during \nprevious site investigations for the LNG Foundation Project was provided by Woodside (Woodside, \n2018b) and is discussed in Section 3.6. From this data, the properties of the in situ material to be dredged \nare reasonably well-known. However, it is not possible to determine how the material properties will be \nchanged by the action of the dredge and the mixing of the material with seawater in the process of \npumping it to the hopper. Therefore, assumptions were made in the model with regard to the material that \nis released into the water column from dredging and the material properties of the sediments that are to \nbe placed at the spoil grounds. \n• \nThe accuracy of the dredging and disposal sediment source terms input to the model. The source \ndefinition in the model is flexible and can be applied to any sediment source by specifying the time-varying \nflux rate, particle size distribution (PSD) and vertical profile in the water column. This information will be \nspecific to the equipment used and the material encountered at the site, and therefore can only be \ndetermined with confidence from a pilot study at the site or field measurements during dredging. In the \nabsence of such data, assumptions were made with regard to these parameters. The assumptions are \noutlined in Section 3.7 and were based on literature review, including the recent WAMSI Dredging Science \nNode reports, and extensive past project experience. \nThe major sources of uncertainty for the sediment fate modelling are the modelled dredging methodology and \nsediment source inputs to the model. The assumptions made were based on literature review and experience, \nand aimed to give a good representation of the sources of suspended sediment that will result from the \nproposed dredging, disposal and backfill activities. However, as there were uncertainties in the inputs to the \nmodel, the results should be considered as indicative of the expected ranges in magnitude and distribution of \nsuspended sediments and sedimentation, rather than an exact prediction. \n--- Page 914 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 18 \n3.4 \nModel Domain and Bathymetry \nThe DREDGEMAP model domain established for the Scarborough dredging works extended approximately \n95 km north-south by 115 km east-west (Figure 3.1). The model grid covers the section of the Western \nAustralian coastline from Regnard Bay, south of West Intercourse Island, to Point Samson in the east. The \noffshore boundaries of the domain were imposed at a reasonable distance from the proposed dredging areas, \nto allow potential sediment drift patterns in offshore directions to be adequately captured. \nThis region lies within the model domain of the Delft3D hydrodynamic and wave models that provide the current \nand wave inputs to DREDGEMAP (see Section 2). A grid resolution of 100 m by 100 m was selected to ensure \nthat existing features in the domain, including the many bays, islands and passages of the Dampier \nArchipelago, were adequately defined. \n \n--- Page 915 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 19 \n \n \n \nDREDGEMAP model domain and bathymetry (m MSL). \n \n--- Page 916 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 20 \n3.5 \nDredging Project Description and Model Operational \nAssumptions \n3.5.1 Overview \nInformation outlining the proposed dredging, disposal and backfill operations for the development of \nScarborough has been drawn from the Scope of Work document (Advisian, 2018), subsequent email \ndiscussions, and input data provided by Woodside and its potential dredging contractors. At the time of \ncommencement of modelling, the collated information represented the best available data with regard to \ngeotechnical properties of the project areas, the dredging and construction methodologies expected to be used \nwithin these areas, and the typical characteristics of vessels that may be engaged for the work. \nThe operations modelled have been broken into two phases with four main activities: \n• \nPhase 1 (Dredging): \n– \nDredging of sediment along the pipeline route; \n– \nDisposal of dredged sediment at three nominated spoil grounds. \n• \nPhase 2 (Backfilling): \n– \nDredging of the borrow ground; \n– \nBackfill and stabilisation of the pipeline. \nThe pipeline route, spoil grounds and borrow grounds will cover State and Commonwealth Waters (Figure \n1.1). \nThe following sections outline the details of the operations for each of these activities and highlight any \nassumptions that were made. \n3.5.2 Methods and Equipment \n3.5.2.1 Pipeline Route Dredging \nThe material to be dredged from the pipeline route will consist mainly of marine sediments (approximately \n3.8 Mm3) and marine sediment/coarse material mix (approximately 0.2 Mm3). \nThe dredging operations for the pipeline route have been divided into ten sections as outlined in Table 3.2, \nwith seven of these sections requiring dredging. The dredging in each of the seven sections was assumed to \nbe completed with either a backhoe dredge (BHD) or a trailing suction hopper dredge (TSHD). Typically, a \nTSHD will dredge unconsolidated sediments and a BHD will dredge sedimentary rock, and the quantities of \neach material type assumed in this case are detailed in Section 3.5.3. The assumed BHD bucket size was in \nthe range of 20 m3 (rock) to 30 m3 (general purpose), while the TSHD hopper size was assumed to be \n12,000 m3 (filled 98% to capacity). It has been specified that overflow of fines from the TSHD hopper and \ndewatering of the split hopper barges that accompany the BHD will be permitted. \nThe estimated cycle times for dredging within each pipeline section where the BHD will operate are presented \nin Table 3.3, and those for each pipeline section where the TSHD will operate are presented in Table 3.4 \n(Woodside, 2018a). \nThe potential for sediment mobilisation by TSHD propeller-wash effects has been considered along all relevant \npipeline sections. This has been done using supplied data on vessel characteristics, and local depth and \n--- Page 917 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 21 \nseabed composition.

Material discharges from the split hopper \nbarges were assumed to occur between depths of 5.8 m and 1.5 m below mean sea level. \nThe TSHD hopper doors, from which discharge will occur, were assumed to be opened at a depth of 12.75 m \nbelow sea level. The modelled vessel draft will be reduced as spoil is discharged to a minimum depth of 8.75 m \nbelow sea level when empty. \nThe split hopper barges will be pushed or towed by a harbour tug. The potential for sediment mobilisation by \ntug propeller-wash effects has been considered along all relevant pipeline sections. This has been done using \nsupplied data on vessel characteristics, and local depth and seabed composition. For the purposes of the \nmodelling assessment, the relevant specifications were as follows: \n• \nVessel draft: 4.5 m (tug). \n• \nNumber of propellers: 2 (ducted). \n• \nDiameter of propellers: 2.5 m. \n• \nThrust power: 1,850 kW per propeller. \nThe allocations of dredge spoil from each pipeline section to each spoil ground are shown in Table 3.5. It was \nassumed that the broad aim of the spoil disposal patterns will be to evenly distribute the total volume of \nallocated material across the entire spoil ground area by the conclusion of all activities, so the spacing of \nindividual disposal operations (which are restricted to a comparatively small area within the spoil ground) was \ndesigned to achieve this. \n \n \n--- Page 919 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 23 \nAnticipated spoil ground allocations of dredge volumes from each pipeline section. \nSpoil Ground \nPipeline Zone \nSpoil Volume (m3) \nSpoil Ground Area \n(m2) \nTheoretical \nThickness (m) \nAB \nPRE1-4 \n501,832 \n4,000,000 \n0.13 \n2B \nPRE6 & 8 \n424,677 \n2,600,000 \n0.16 \n5A \nPRE10 \n943,032 \n3,200,000 \n0.29 \n \n3.5.2.3 Borrow Ground Dredging \nDredging of backfill material from the borrow ground locations will consist of the removal of approximately \n2 Mm3 of sandy sediments with a low proportion of fines. \nIt was assumed that dredging of the borrow grounds will be conducted using a TSHD, with two options \nmodelled. For Option A all material will be dredged from borrow ground A, and for Option B all material will be \ndredged from borrow ground B (Figure 1.1). The TSHD hopper size was assumed to be 9,700 m3 (filled at a \nrate of approximately 90 m3/min). It has been specified that overflow of fines from the TSHD hopper will be \npermitted. \nThe estimated cycle times for TSHD dredging within the borrow grounds and placement of material within each \npipeline section are presented in Table 3.6 (Woodside, 2018a). \nThe pipeline route runs through the eastern edge of borrow ground B. Although the dredging and backfill \nactivities are obviously not coincident in time, it has been assumed that dredging of backfill material will be \nrestricted to approximately the western three-quarters of the borrow ground to avoid disturbing the previously-\ndredged pipeline route. \nThe potential for sediment mobilisation by TSHD propeller-wash effects has been considered in both borrow \ngrounds. This has been done using supplied data on vessel characteristics, and local depth and seabed \ncomposition. For the purposes of the modelling assessment, the relevant specifications were as follows: \n• \nVessel draft: 10.0 m loaded and 6.0 m empty. \n• \nNumber of propellers: 2 (ducted). \n• \nDiameter of propellers: 4.0 m. \n• \nThrust power: 5,800 kW per propeller. \n \nEstimated cycle times for each pipeline section where the TSHD will be placing material \ndredged from the borrow grounds. \nPipeline Zone \nNon-Overflow \nTime (min) \nOverflow Time \n(min) \nPlacement Time \n(min) \nSailing Time \n(min) \nTotal Cycle Time \n(min) \nPOST2 \n30 \n74 \n107 \n46 \n257 \nPOST4 \n30 \n74 \n107 \n46 \n257 \nPOST6 \n30 \n74 \n107 \n53 \n264 \nPOST8 \n30 \n74 \n107 \n53 \n264 \nPOST10 \n30 \n74 \n107 \n58 \n269 \n--- Page 920 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 24 \n3.5.2.4 Pipeline Route Backfill \nThe backfill operations for the pipeline route have been divided into ten sections as outlined in Table 3.7. It \nwas assumed that rock backfill will be placed by a side-dump vessel and sand backfill will be placed by a \nTSHD. \nThe side-dump vessel was assumed to have a capacity of 4,500 tonnes with an average installation rate of \napproximately 2,250 tonnes/hr, with rock dumped from a fixed height at the sea surface. The TSHD hopper \nsize was assumed to be 9,700 m3 (emptied at a rate of approximately 90 m3/min), with sand discharged \nthrough the suction pipe at an elevation of approximately 5 m above the pipeline. \nThe potential for sediment mobilisation by TSHD and side-dump vessel propeller-wash effects has been \nconsidered along the relevant pipeline sections. This has been done using supplied data on vessel \ncharacteristics, and local depth and seabed composition. For the purposes of the modelling assessment, the \nrelevant specifications were as follows: \n• \nVessel draft: \n– \n10.0 m loaded and 6.0 m empty (TSHD). \n– \n4.8 m loaded (side-dump vessel). \n• \nNumber of propellers: \n– \n2 (ducted; TSHD). \n– \n2+2 (ducted; side-dump vessel). \n• \nDiameter of propellers: \n– \n4.0 m (TSHD). \n– \n2.5 m (side-dump vessel). \n• \nThrust power: \n– \n5,800 kW per propeller (TSHD). \n– \n2 x 1,250 kW and 2 x 1,000 kW (side-dump vessel). \n \n \n--- Page 921 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 25 \nProvisional outline of proposed pipeline backfill and stabilisation activities. \nPipeline Zone \nPipeline Location \nVessel \nTask Description \nBorrow Location \nPOST1 \nKP0.1 – KP0.6 \nSide-dump vessel \nRock backfill (1.2-2.0 m cover over \ntop of pipe). \nRock from the \nNickol Bay Quarry. \nPOST2 \nKP0.6 – KP3.6 \nTSHD \nSand backfill (≥3.0 m cover over top \nof pipe). \nSand from the \nborrow grounds \nindicated in Figure \n1.1. \nPOST3 \nKP3.6 – KP4.6 \nSide-dump vessel Rock backfill (2.0 m cover over top of \npipe). \nRock from the \nNickol Bay Quarry. \nPOST4 \nKP4.6 – KP6.2 \nTSHD \nSand backfill (1.7-2.5 m cover over \ntop of pipe). \nSand from the \nborrow grounds \nindicated in Figure \n1.1. \nPOST5 \nKP6.2 – KP11.0 \nSide-dump vessel \nNo cover rock berm (flush to top of \npipe). \nRock from the \nNickol Bay Quarry. \nPOST6 \nKP11.0 – KP18.4 \nTSHD \nSand backfill (0.8-1.7 m cover over \ntop of pipe). \nSand from the \nborrow grounds \nindicated in Figure \n1.1. \nPOST7 \nKP18.4 – KP19.3 \nSide-dump vessel \nNo cover rock berm (flush to top of \npipe). \nRock from the \nNickol Bay Quarry. \nPOST8 \nKP19.3 – KP21.3 \nTSHD \nSand backfill (1.2-1.7 m cover over \ntop of pipe). \nSand from the \nborrow grounds \nindicated in Figure \n1.1. \nPOST9 \nKP21.3 – KP24.4 \nSide-dump vessel \nNo cover rock berm (flush to top of \npipe). \nRock from the \nNickol Bay Quarry. \nPOST10 \nKP24.4 – KP50.0 \nTSHD \nSand backfill (0.7-1.7 m cover over \ntop of pipe). \nSand from the \nborrow grounds \nindicated in Figure \n1.1. \n \n3.5.3 Quantities and Production Rates \nFor dredging of each section along the pipeline route, the proposed dredge depths, quantities for each material \ntype, and production rates for each material type were specified for input to the modelling (Table 3.8).

It is understood that no “hard” material (andesite igneous rock) will be present due to its \nremoval during capital dredging activities for the LNG Foundation Project (Woodside, 2018b). \nFor sand backfill of each relevant section along the pipeline route, which involves dredging of one of the two \npotential borrow grounds, the proposed quantities and production rates for each material type were specified \nfor input to the modelling (Table 3.9). The sole material category within the borrow grounds was assumed to \nbe unconsolidated sediments (“soft” material). It was also assumed that production rates for dredging at each \npotential borrow ground were identical. \nFor rock backfill section where rock is to be placed, quantities for each material category were specified (Table \n3.10). \n--- Page 922 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 26 \nIt is understood that: \n• \nThe estimated material quantities were based on the latest surveyed bathymetry and a geotechnical \nmodel incorporating existing geotechnical data; \n• \nThe estimated production rates were based on the material type and equipment that may be used for \ndredging; \n• \nThe estimated production rates were average values inclusive of expected downtime estimates. \n \nModelled dredge depths, quantities of material type, and production rates by material type \nfor dredging of each pipeline section. \nPipeline Zone \nDredge Depth \n(m CD) \nDredged Quantities (m3) \nProduction Rates (m3/week) \n \nTarget \nSoft Material \nModerate \nMaterial \nTotal \nSoft Material \nModerate \nMaterial \nPRE1 \n+4.3 / -5.5 \n13,811 \n10,131 \n23,942 \n40-60,000 \n15-20,000 \nPRE2 \n-13.1 / -11.1 \n216,995 \n21,256 \n238,251 \n175-225,000 \n15-20,000 \nPRE3 \n-10.7 / -18.6 \n131,992 \n- \n131,992 \n175-225,000 \n- \nPRE4 \n-9.7 / -11.3 \n87,890 \n19,760 \n107,650 \n175-225,000 \n15-20,000 \nPRE6 \n-13.0 / -16.0 \n349,334 \n- \n349,334 \n175-225,000 \n- \nPRE8 \n-14.4 / -17.7 \n75,343 \n- \n75,343 \n175-225,000 \n- \nPRE10 \n-24.0 / -44.9 \n943,032 \n- \n943,032 \n175-225,000 \n- \nTotals \n1,818,397 \n51,147 \n1,869,544 \n- \n- \n \nModelled quantities of material type and production rates by material type for dredging of \nsand backfill material for each pipeline section from the borrow grounds. \nPipeline Zone \nDredged/Backfill Quantities (m3) \nProduction Rates (m3/week) \nSoft Material \nSoft Material \nPOST2 \n159,992 \n325,000 \nPOST4 \n80,394 \n325,000 \nPOST6 \n349,334 \n325,000 \nPOST8 \n75,343 \n325,000 \nPOST10 \n943,032 \n325,000 \nTotals \n1,608,095 \n- \n \n \n--- Page 923 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 27 \nModelled quantities of material type for placement of rock backfill material within each \npipeline section. \nPipeline Zone \nBackfill Quantities (m3) \nMaterial Category 1 \nMaterial Category 2 \nTotal \nPOST1 \n4,577 \n5,399 \n9,976 \nPOST3 \n8,395 \n21,979 \n30,374 \nPOST5 \n6,384 \n10,032 \n16,416 \nPOST7 \n2,170 \n3,410 \n5,580 \nPOST9 \n4,270 \n6,710 \n10,980 \nTotals \n25,896 \n47,530 \n73,426 \n \n3.5.4 Schedules \nFor dredging of each section along the pipeline route, the proposed duration and sequencing of operations \nhas been specified for input to the modelling (Table 3.11).

The outcomes of each borrow ground dredging option have also been analysed \nand presented separately for each of the two seasonal scenarios. \n3.6 \nGeotechnical Information \nThe dredged material from the pipeline route will consist mainly of marine sediments (approximately 3.8 Mm3) \nand marine sediment/coarse material mix (approximately 0.2 Mm3). The backfill material to be dredged from \nthe borrow ground locations will consist of the removal of 2 Mm3 of sandy sediments with a low proportion of \nfines. \nThe critical geotechnical information required as input to the modelling is PSD data for the sediments to be \ndredged along the pipeline route, for the sediments to be dredged from the borrow grounds and for the quarry-\nrock material. \nThis data has been specified (Woodside, 2018b) for the dredging and sand backfill operations relating to each \npipeline section. The resultant PSDs for each pipeline section have been redistributed to match the material \nsize classes used in the DREDGEMAP model, as shown in Table 3.13, Table 3.14 and Table 3.15. \nFor the rock backfill operations, in the absence of grading information it has been conservatively assumed that \nthe fraction of material within the quarry rubble classified as “fines” in this context (diameters less than 100 mm) \n--- Page 926 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 30 \nwill be 5% of the total volume. From experience, this is a typical upper limit for the “fines” fraction of well-\ngraded limestone rubble, with the breakdown of this figure into smaller size classes usually unknown. Although \nthe most conservative approach would be to further assume that all of the “fines” material is potentially \navailable for resuspension into the water column, the assumed PSD has been heavily slanted towards the \nleast-mobile coarse sand (>130 μm) category to account for the typically minimal proportion of the finest \nmaterial categories. The chosen PSD is shown in Table 3.16. \nThe PSD data for borrow ground A can be characterised mainly as coarse sand with a low fines fraction, with \ncoarseness and layer thickness increasing towards the eastern part of the borrow ground. For modelling \npurposes, PSDs measured close to the proposed trunkline route between KP30 and KP50 have been used. \nThese PSDs consider a medium sand with higher fines content and are thus considered conservative. \nThe PSD data for borrow ground B is aligned with measured PSDs close to the proposed trunkline route \nbetween KP14 and KP19. For backfill purposes, a material with a PSD curve showing a d10 > 100 µm and a \nd50 > 300 µm is required to ensure the long-term stability of the pipeline. Borrow ground B is expected to have \na substantially lower yield of acceptable material for trench backfill use. \nIn addition to PSD information, data and assumptions relating to the dry bulk density of the material to be \ndredged from the pipeline route and borrow grounds, and of the quarry-rock material, was used as input to the \nmodelling. A typical average dry bulk density value of 2,150 kg/m3 was assumed. \n \nIn situ PSDs broken down into DREDGEMAP material classes for each pipeline section to \nbe dredged, derived from available geotechnical information. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nZone \nPRE1 \n(%) \nZone \nPRE2 \n(%) \nZone \nPRE3 \n(%) \nZone \nPRE4 \n(%) \nZone \nPRE6 \n(%) \nZone \nPRE8 \n(%) \nZone \nPRE10 \n(%) \nClay \n<7 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n1.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n1.0 \n8.0 \n(<KP30) \n2.5 \n(>KP30) \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n1.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n1.0 \n12.0 \n(<KP30) \n2.5 \n(>KP30) \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n16.0 \n16.0 \n16.0 \n16.0 \n16.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n4.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n4.0 \n14.0 \n(<KP30) \n10.0 \n(>KP30) \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n2.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n2.0 \n14.0 \n(<KP30) \n15.0 \n(>KP30) \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n40.0 \n40.0 \n40.0 \n40.0 \n40.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n92.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n92.0 \n52.0 \n(<KP30) \n70.0 \n(>KP30) \n \n \n--- Page 927 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 31 \nIn situ PSDs broken down into DREDGEMAP material classes for the sand backfill material \nof each pipeline section if it were dredged from borrow ground A, derived from available \ngeotechnical information. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nZone POST2 \n(%) \nZone POST4 \n(%) \nZone POST6 \n(%) \nZone POST8 \n(%) \nZone POST10 \n(%) \nClay \n<7 \n2.5 \n2.5 \n2.5 \n2.5 \n2.5 \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n2.5 \n2.5 \n2.5 \n2.5 \n2.5 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n15.0 \n15.0 \n15.0 \n15.0 \n15.0 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n70.0 \n70.0 \n70.0 \n70.0 \n70.0 \n \nIn situ PSDs broken down into DREDGEMAP material classes for the sand backfill material \nof each pipeline section if it were dredged from borrow ground B, derived from available \ngeotechnical information. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nZone POST2 \n(%) \nZone POST4 \n(%) \nZone POST6 \n(%) \nZone POST8 \n(%) \nZone POST10 \n(%) \nClay \n<7 \n1.0 \n1.0 \n1.0 \n1.0 \n1.0 \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n1.0 \n1.0 \n1.0 \n1.0 \n1.0 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n4.0 \n4.0 \n4.0 \n4.0 \n4.0 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n92.0 \n92.0 \n92.0 \n92.0 \n92.0 \n \nIn situ PSDs broken down into DREDGEMAP material classes for the rock backfill material \nof each pipeline section, assumed as typical values for well-graded limestone rubble. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nZone POST1 \n(%) \nZone POST3 \n(%) \nZone POST5 \n(%) \nZone POST7 \n(%) \nZone POST9 \n(%) \nClay \n<7 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n98.0 \n98.0 \n98.0 \n98.0 \n98.0 \n \n \n--- Page 928 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 32 \n3.7 \nModel Sediment Sources \n3.7.1 Overview \nTo accurately represent the pipeline dredging, disposal and backfill operations in DREDGEMAP, a range of \ninformation was defined for the proposed operations, including dredge, disposal and backfill methodology, \nproduction rates, sediment/rock types and quantities (see Section 3.5). It is evident that there will be seven \ndifferent sources of suspended sediment plumes during dredging, disposal and backfill operations, which can \nbe broadly defined as: \n• \nDirect suspension of material from the BHD bucket, from grabbing and lifting unconsolidated sediments \nand sedimentary rock through the water column, accounting for periods of no-dewatering and dewatering \nfrom the split hopper barge; \n• \nDisposal of sediment and rock excavated by the BHD from split hopper barges to the nominated spoil \ngrounds; \n• \nDirect suspension of material by the TSHD during dredging of unconsolidated sediments, accounting for \nno-overflow and overflow periods; \n• \nDisposal of sediment dredged by the TSHD to the nominated spoil grounds; \n• \nIndirect suspension of material due to the propeller wash of the BHD barge tug and TSHD while dredging; \n• \nSuspension of material during backfill activities, via TSHD, using sediments dredged from the borrow \nground; \n• \nSuspension of material during backfill activities, via side-dump vessel, using rock from onshore quarries. \nEach of these sources of suspended sediment plumes will vary in strength and persistence depending on the \nnature of the operations. In the DREDGEMAP model, each source is defined by specifying the time-varying \nflux rate, PSD and vertical profile in the water column. The following sections outline how the information \nprovided has been used to represent the dredging operations in the model and explain any assumptions that \nhave been made to supplement the available information. \n3.7.2 Representation of BHD Dredging \nA BHD will be used to excavate all unconsolidated sediments and sedimentary rock material from zone PRE1, \nand all sedimentary rock material from zones PRE2 and PRE4 (following TSHD dredging of unconsolidated \nsediments in these zones). The BHD will use a large excavator arm fitted with an open bucket of (nominally) \n20-30 m3 capacity. The excavator will lift material in the bucket and deliver it to one of two waiting split hopper \nbarges – assumed for the purposes of modelling to be 3,800 m3 in capacity – for transport to spoil ground AB \nfor disposal. \nSources of sediment suspension from this type of operation include: \n• \nDisturbance of the seabed sediments by the excavator bucket; \n• \nDewatering of the split hopper barge, resulting in the discharge of water and entrained sediments. \nPast observations have shown that material is suspended due to the initial grab at the seabed. Further \nsuspension is generated as sediment spills from the bucket as it is lifted through the water column. Spillage of \nwater and sediment also occurs as the bucket breaks free of the water surface and drains freely. Only \nsediments <130 μm in diameter are considered “lost” (i.e. suspended into the water column), because the \ncoarser material spilled from the bucket while being lifted to the surface will fall immediately to the bottom \n--- Page 929 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 33 \nwhere it will be re-dredged during subsequent grabs. As such, the distribution of material suspended by the \nbucket spillage is assumed to be distributed across the four smaller sediment size classes in the model. \nFor the dredging of the unconsolidated sediments during periods with no dewatering from the barge, the PSD \nused in the model is based on PSDs from nearby boreholes (see Section 3.6), with the proportion >130 μm \nremoved and the remaining distribution normalised to 100% by scaling up the proportions in the four remaining \nsize classes (Table 3.17). The same PSD is used for the sedimentary rock component, assuming that due to \nthe excavation action of the BHD the rock will break down into similar proportions of fines. Because the \ndredging action of the excavator involves no cutting or hydraulic pumping, this is a conservative assumption. \nDuring dewatering periods, an increase in the rate of release of fine sediments, and hence initial turbidity, is \nobserved (Anchor Environmental, 2003). The water released during dewatering of the barge contains a high \nproportion of fines because the coarse material settles rapidly in the barge while the fine material remains in \nsuspension. After the barge begins dewatering, a PSD heavily weighted towards finer particles has been \nassumed based on previous field measurements of hopper barge dewatering at Geraldton Port (OPR, 2010), \nwith the proportion >75 μm removed and the remaining distribution normalised to 100% by scaling up the \nproportions in the three remaining size classes (Table 3.18). \nthe barge is not dewatering. The distribution is higher at the seabed and water surface, to represent the larger \nloss rate of material during the initial grab and as the bucket breaks free of the water column. After the barge \nbegins dewatering, a uniform distribution of sediments throughout the water column, between the hull depth \nand the seabed, has been assumed to represent a continuous stream of material being discharged from the \nbarge (Table 3.20). \n \nAssumed PSDs of sediments initially suspended into the water column during BHD \ndredging operations along the pipeline route while the barge is not dewatering. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nPSD (%) for Sediment \nand Sedimentary Rock \nRemoval – Zone PRE1 \nPSD (%) for Sedimentary \nRock Removal – Zone \nPRE2 \nPSD (%) for Sedimentary \nRock Removal – Zone \nPRE4 \nClay \n<7 \n16.7 \n16.7 \n16.7 \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n23.3 \n23.3 \n23.3 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n26.7 \n26.7 \n26.7 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n33.3 \n33.3 \n33.3 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n \n--- Page 930 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 34 \nAssumed PSDs of sediments initially suspended into the water column during BHD \ndredging operations along the pipeline route while the barge is dewatering. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nPSD (%) for Sediment \nand Sedimentary Rock \nRemoval – Zone PRE1 \nPSD (%) for Sedimentary \nRock Removal – Zone \nPRE2 \nPSD (%) for Sedimentary \nRock Removal – Zone \nPRE4 \nClay \n<7 \n43.0 \n43.0 \n43.0 \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n30.2 \n30.2 \n30.2 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n26.8 \n26.8 \n26.8 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \nAssumed vertical distribution of sediments initially suspended into the water column \nduring BHD dredging operations along the pipeline route while the barge is not \ndewatering. \nElevation \nExample Elevation (m ASB) – 10 m \nWater Depth \nVertical Distribution (%) of \nSediments \nSurface/water depth \n10.0 \n23.0 \n0.8 x water depth \n8.0 \n16.0 \n0.5 x water depth \n5.0 \n14.0 \n0.3 x water depth \n3.0 \n19.0 \n0.1 x water depth \n1.0 \n28.0 \n \nAssumed vertical distribution of sediments initially suspended into the water column \nduring BHD dredging operations along the pipeline route while the barge is dewatering. \nElevation \nExample Elevation (m ASB) – 10 m \nWater Depth and 5.8 m Hull Depth \nVertical Distribution (%) of \nSediments \nHopper hull elevation \n4.2 \n20.0 \n0.75 x hull elevation \n3.2 \n20.0 \n0.50 x hull elevation \n2.1 \n20.0 \n0.25 x hull elevation \n1.0 \n20.0 \n0.50 m (ASB) \n0.5 \n20.0 \n \nLoss rates from similar operations are known to vary based on such factors as the size and type of bucket (i.e. \nopen or closed), nature of the seabed material, presence of debris, current speed and depth of water, as well \nas the care of the operator (Hayes & Wu, 2001; Anchor Environmental, 2003). Reported rates compared by \nAnchor Environmental (2003) varied from 0.1% to 10%, with a mean of 2.1%. In the absence of measurements \nfor the specific situation and equipment, the mean of 2.1% of production rate is assumed for all BHD operations \nduring periods with no dewatering, and a rate of 2.4% of production rate is assumed for all BHD operations \n--- Page 931 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 35 \nduring dewatering periods. The latter value is in line with the overflow rate calculated for the TSHD hopper \noverflow (see Section 3.7.4). \n3.7.3 Representation of Disposal of BHD-Dredged Material \nAll material dredged by the BHD will be placed into one of two waiting 3,800 m3 split hopper barges and \ntransported (by harbour tug) to spoil ground AB for disposal. This material will include all unconsolidated \nsediments and sedimentary rock material from zone PRE1, and all sedimentary rock material from zones PRE2 \nand PRE4. \nFor the disposal of the unconsolidated sediments dredged by BHD, the PSD used in the model is based on \nPSDs from nearby boreholes (see Section 3.6). The same PSD is used for the sedimentary rock component, \nassuming that due to the excavation action of the BHD the rock will break down into similar proportions of \nfines. Because the dredging action of the excavator involves no cutting or hydraulic pumping, this is a \nconservative assumption. This PSD is adjusted by removal of the component treated as suspended during \ndredging (see Section 3.7.2), but as this represents only 2.1% of the mass for the minor components, the \nmodified PSD is not significantly different to the in situ PSD (Table 3.21). \nOnce at the AB spoil ground, the split hopper barge will open to release the sediments from the bottom of the \nhull at a depth of approximately 5.8 m below sea level. Previous observations of sediment dumping from \nhopper vessels (e.g. CSMW, 2005) have shown that there is an initial rapid descent of solids, with the heavy \nparticles tending to entrain lighter particles, followed by a billowing of lighter components back into the water \ncolumn after contact with the seabed (Figure 3.2). A proportion of the lighter components will also remain \nsuspended and may be trapped by density layers, if present. \nBecause simulations in this study focused on the far-field fate of sediment particles due to transport and sinking \nafter the initial dump phase, simulations were run with the initial vertical distribution specified to represent the \npost-collision phase for a case where a high proportion of the sediments are resuspended after collision with \nthe seabed. To represent this, an assumed vertical distribution for the sediments (Table 3.22) has been \nspecified following published information from previous hopper disposal operations (CSMW, 2005; NEPA, \n2001). This vertical distribution, with the majority of the material input near the seabed and only 7% of the \nmaterial released in the upper half of the water column, is in line with values quoted in the recent literature \nreview by Mills & Kemps (2016), which found that sediment resuspension from individual dredged material \ndisposal events was generally less than 10% of the disposed material load. \nIt is estimated that 95-99% of the bulk load deposits directly onto the seabed in a typical case, with the \nremainder released into the water column (CSMW, 2005, NEPA, 2001). It is difficult to find other definitive \nsource values in the literature, but a value of 5% of each load agrees well with past experience and appears \nto be a conservative estimate based on the values quoted above. Accordingly, 5% of each hopper load was \nplaced in suspension in the water column in the sediment fate model. \nIn addition to the proportion of material immediately suspended in the water column, disposal from the barge \nwill result in the stockpiling of sediment as a mound on the seabed that will be subject to resuspension by tidal \nand wave forces. Because fine sediments in the deposited mass may be subject to ongoing resuspension and \ndispersion over time, it was necessary to specify the deposits as a further source of sediment potentially subject \nto resuspension. For this purpose, it was assumed that 5% of the deposited mass – representing the upper \nsurface layer – would be subject to resuspension. It should be noted that the model maintains a mass balance \nestimate of the remaining sediment of each size class within each grid cell to derive an estimate of the median \nparticle size in the surface-layer sediments. In turn, the potential for ongoing resuspension of fines is \ncalculated. In this way, the model represents the increased armouring of sediments as the average particle \nsize increases. \n--- Page 932 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 36 \nThe disposal time for the barge material within each dredge cycle was assumed to be 20 minutes (Table 3.3). \nThe disposal location within spoil ground AB was varied for each dredge cycle in a randomised manner, with \nthe ultimate aim of ensuring an even distribution of dredged material within the spoil ground by the conclusion \nof all activities. \n \nAssumed PSDs of sediments initially suspended into the water column during split \nhopper barge disposal operations at spoil ground AB. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nPSD (%) for Sediment \nand Sedimentary Rock \nDisposal – Zone PRE1 \nPSD (%) for Sedimentary \nRock Disposal – Zone \nPRE2 \nPSD (%) for Sedimentary \nRock Disposal – Zone \nPRE4 \nClay \n<7 \n9.7 \n9.7 \n9.7 \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n13.5 \n13.5 \n13.5 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n15.4 \n15.4 \n15.4 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n19.3 \n19.3 \n19.3 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n42.1 \n42.1 \n42.1 \n \nAssumed vertical distribution of sediments initially suspended into the water column \nduring split hopper barge disposal operations at spoil ground AB. \nElevation \nExample Elevation (m ASB) – 10 m \nWater Depth \nVertical Distribution (%) of \nSediments \nSurface/water depth \n10.0 \n2.0 \n0.6 x water depth \n6.0 \n5.0 \n0.4 x water depth \n4.0 \n15.0 \n0.15 x water depth \n1.5 \n35.0 \n0.1 x water depth \n1.0 \n43.0 \n \n \n--- Page 933 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 37 \n \nConceptual diagram showing the general behaviour of sediments dumped from a split \nhopper barge and the vertical distribution of material set up by entrainment and billowing \n(source: ASA, 2004). \n \n3.7.4 Representation of TSHD Dredging \nA TSHD will be used to excavate all unconsolidated sediments from zones PRE2, PRE3 and PRE4 with \ndisposal at spoil ground AB, zones PRE6 and PRE8 with disposal at spoil ground 2B, and zone PRE10 with \ndisposal at spoil ground 5A. A smaller TSHD will be used to dredge backfill material from the borrow grounds, \nwith disposal along the pipeline route. For the purposes of modelling, the capacities of the TSHDs to be used \nfor dredging of the pipeline route and borrow grounds were assumed as 12,000 m3 and 9,700 m3, respectively. \nTSHD vessels remove sediments by dragging a large drag-head over the seabed and drawing up the disturbed \nsediment by hydraulic suction. Sources of sediment suspension from this type of operation include: \n• \nHydraulic disturbance of the seabed sediments by the trailing arm; \n• \nPropeller-wash generated as the vessel manoeuvres; \n• \nOverflow of the on-board hoppers, resulting in the discharge of water and entrained sediments. \nThe characteristics of each of these sources vary greatly due to a wide range of factors (USACE, 2008) making \nthe generalisation of source terms difficult. It appears however, that the overflow source term is dominant, \nbeing typically an order of magnitude greater than the drag-head and propeller-wash terms. \nFor the dredging of the unconsolidated sediments during periods with no overflow, the PSDs used in the model \nare based on PSDs from nearby boreholes (see Section 3.6). The PSDs applied to dredging along the pipeline \n--- Page 934 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 38 \nroute and within the borrow grounds are shown in Table 3.23 and Table 3.25, respectively. During overflow \nperiods, an increase in the rate of release of fine sediments, and hence initial turbidity, is observed (Anchor \nEnvironmental, 2003). The overflow water contains a high proportion of fines because the coarse material \nsettles rapidly in the hopper while the fine material remains in suspension. After the hopper begins overflowing, \nPSDs heavily weighted towards finer particles has been assumed based on previous field measurements of \nhopper barge overflow at Geraldton Port (OPR, 2010), with the proportion >75 μm removed and the remaining \ndistribution normalised to 100% by scaling up the proportions in the three remaining size classes. The PSDs \napplied to dredging along the pipeline route and within the borrow grounds are shown in Table 3.24 and Table \n3.26, respectively. \nwhile the hopper is not overflowing. The distribution is concentrated near the seabed and decreases in intensity \ntowards the surface, to represent the disturbance of seabed material by the drag-head and propeller-wash \neffects (HR Wallingford, 2003). After the hopper begins overflowing, a uniform distribution of sediments \nthroughout the water column, between the hull depth and the seabed, has been assumed to represent a \ncontinuous stream of material being discharged from the hopper (Table 3.28). This is consistent with measured \nADCP profiles presented by Hitchcock & Bell (2004), which show a reasonably even distribution of sediment \nthrough the water column during hopper overflow. \n \nAssumed PSDs of sediments initially suspended into the water column during TSHD \ndredging operations along the pipeline route while the hopper is not overflowing. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE2 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE3 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE4 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE6 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE8 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone \nPRE10 \nClay \n<7 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n1.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n1.0 \n8.0 \n(<KP30) \n2.5 \n(>KP30) \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n1.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n1.0 \n12.0 \n(<KP30) \n2.5 \n(>KP30) \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n16.0 \n16.0 \n16.0 \n16.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n4.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n4.0 \n14.0 \n(<KP30) \n10.0 \n(>KP30) \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n2.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n2.0 \n14.0 \n(<KP30) \n15.0 \n(>KP30) \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n40.0 \n40.0 \n40.0 \n40.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n92.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n92.0 \n52.0 \n(<KP30) \n70.0 \n(>KP30) \n \n \n--- Page 935 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 39 \nAssumed PSDs of sediments initially suspended into the water column during TSHD \ndredging operations along the pipeline route while the hopper is overflowing. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE2 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE3 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE4 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE6 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone PRE8 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nRemoval – \nZone \nPRE10 \nClay \n<7 \n43.0 \n43.0 \n43.0 \n43.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n52.7 \n(>KP16.5) \n52.7 \n52.7 \n(<KP30) \n44.3 \n(>KP30) \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n30.2 \n30.2 \n30.2 \n30.2 \n(<KP16.5) \n26.4 \n(>KP16.5) \n26.4 \n26.4 \n(<KP30) \n29.8 \n(>KP30) \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n26.8 \n26.8 \n26.8 \n26.8 \n(<KP16.5) \n20.9 \n(>KP16.5) \n20.9 \n20.9 \n(<KP30) \n25.9 \n(>KP30) \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \nAssumed PSDs of sediments initially suspended into the water column during TSHD \ndredging operations at borrow grounds A and B while the hopper is not overflowing. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(μm) \nPSD (%) for Sediment Removal – \nBorrow Ground A \nPSD (%) for Sediment Removal – \nBorrow Ground B \nClay \n<7 \n2.5 \n1.0 \nFine Silt \n7-34 \n2.5 \n1.0 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n10.0 \n4.0 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n15.0 \n2.0 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n70.0 \n92.0 \n \nAssumed PSDs of sediments initially suspended into the water column during TSHD \ndredging operations at borrow grounds A and B while the hopper is overflowing. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(μm) \nPSD (%) for Sediment Removal – \nBorrow Ground A \nPSD (%) for Sediment Removal – \nBorrow Ground B \nClay \n<7 \n49.2 \n52.7 \nFine Silt \n7-34 \n25.5 \n26.4 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n25.3 \n20.9 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n--- Page 936 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 40 \nAssumed vertical distribution of sediments initially suspended into the water column \nduring TSHD dredging operations along the pipeline route and at borrow grounds A and \nB while the hopper is not overflowing. \nElevation \nExample Elevation (m ASB) – 30 m \nWater Depth \nVertical Distribution (%) of \nSediments \n10.0 m (ASB) \n10.0 \n5.0 \n7.0 m (ASB) \n7.0 \n15.0 \n3.0 m (ASB) \n3.0 \n20.0 \n2.0 m (ASB) \n2.0 \n40.0 \n1.0 m (ASB) \n1.0 \n20.0 \n \nAssumed vertical distribution of sediments initially suspended into the water column \nduring TSHD dredging operations along the pipeline route and at borrow grounds A and \nB while the hopper is overflowing. \nElevation \nExample Elevation (m ASB) – 30 m \nWater Depth and 10 m Hull Depth \nVertical Distribution (%) of \nSediments \nHopper hull elevation \n20.0 \n20.0 \n0.75 x hull elevation \n15.0 \n20.0 \n0.50 x hull elevation \n10.0 \n20.0 \n0.25 x hull elevation \n5.0 \n20.0 \n0.50 m (ASB) \n0.5 \n20.0 \n \nThe resuspension of sediment when the TSHD hopper is not overflowing was estimated by combining the \ndrag-head and propeller-wash terms. The propeller-wash component typically dominates the drag-head \ncomponent, but both sources were assessed. Propeller wash generation was estimated by applying a model \nof the bed-induced shear stress from the larger of the TSHD vessels (12,000 m3 capacity) over the range of \nunder-keel clearances expected during the dredging operations. \nField measurements of drag-head-induced sediment suspension was reported by Coastline Surveys Ltd (CSL, \n1999). The inferred production rate was less than 1 kg/s and it was concluded that, generally, drag-head \nproduction is small in comparison to the quantity of sediment released via overflow. Given the above, a loss \nrate of 0.6% of the gross production rate, representing a combined sediment flux due to losses from the drag-\nhead and propeller-wash, was assumed when the TSHD is not overflowing. This rate is within the range of \nvalues (less than 1%) summarised in a review of contemporary practice conducted as part of the WAMSI \nDredging Science Node by Kemps & Masini (2017). \nThe resuspension of sediment when the TSHD hopper is overflowing was estimated based on measurements \ntaken of the concentrations within overflowing waters, which are generally less than 10,000 mg/L adjacent to \nthe hopper (Hitchcock & Bell, 2004). Typical values appear to be in the 5,000-6,000 mg/L range, which \ncorrelate well with data drawn from other Western Australian projects that cannot be cited here for reasons of \nconfidentiality. A conservative hopper overflow concentration of 10,000 mg/L was assumed for this study, \nwhich – when balanced with the expected pumping and loading rates of the dredge – resulted in a source \nestimate of 2.4% of the gross production rate. This flux rate is a conservative rate compared to the range of \n--- Page 937 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 41 \npublished measurements from TSHD operations (0.1-5.0%; Hayes & Wu, 2001) and is within the range of \nvalues used in modelling studies (0.3-9.8%) outlined in a review of contemporary practice by Kemps & Masini \n(2017). \n3.7.5 Representation of Disposal of TSHD-Dredged Material \nAll material dredged by the TSHD along the pipeline route will be transported to spoil ground AB, 2B or 5A (as \nappropriate) for disposal. This material will include all unconsolidated sediments from zones PRE2, PRE3, \nPRE4, PRE6, PRE8 and PRE10. \nFor the disposal of the unconsolidated sediments dredged by TSHD, the PSDs used in the model are based \non PSDs from nearby boreholes (see Section 3.6). These PSDs are adjusted by removal of the component \ntreated as suspended during dredging along the pipeline route (see Section 3.7.4), but as this represents only \nbetween 0.6% and 2.4% (averaged value depending on the relative contributions of overflow and non-overflow \nperiods to the overall mass flux) of the mass for the minor components, the modified PSDs are not significantly \ndifferent to the in situ PSDs (Table 3.29). \nOnce at the appropriate spoil ground, the hopper will open to release the sediments from the bottom of the hull \nat a depth of approximately 12.75 m below sea level. Previous observations of sediment dumping from hopper \nvessels (e.g. CSMW, 2005) have shown that there is an initial rapid descent of solids, with the heavy particles \ntending to entrain lighter particles, followed by a billowing of lighter components back into the water column \nafter contact with the seabed (Figure 3.3). A proportion of the lighter components will also remain suspended \nand may be trapped by density layers, if present. \nBecause simulations in this study focused on the far-field fate of sediment particles due to transport and sinking \nafter the initial dump phase, simulations were run with the initial vertical distribution specified to represent the \npost-collision phase for a case where a high proportion of the sediments are resuspended after collision with \nthe seabed. To represent this, an assumed vertical distribution for the sediments (Table 3.30) has been \nspecified following published information from previous hopper disposal operations (CSMW, 2005; NEPA, \n2001). This vertical distribution, with the majority of the material input near the seabed and only 15% of the \nmaterial released at hull depth or above, is in line with values quoted in the recent literature review by Mills & \nKemps (2016), which found that sediment resuspension from individual dredged material disposal events was \ngenerally less than 10% of the disposed material load. \nIt is estimated that 95-99% of the bulk load deposits directly onto the seabed in a typical case, with the \nremainder released into the water column (CSMW, 2005, NEPA, 2001). It is difficult to find other definitive \nsource values in the literature, but a value of 5% of each load agrees well with past experience and appears \nto be a conservative estimate based on the values quoted above. Accordingly, 5% of each hopper load was \nplaced in suspension in the water column in the sediment fate model. \nIn addition to the proportion of material immediately suspended in the water column, disposal from the hopper \nwill result in the stockpiling of sediment as a mound on the seabed that will be subject to resuspension by tidal \nand wave forces. Because fine sediments in the deposited mass may be subject to ongoing resuspension and \ndispersion over time, it was necessary to specify the deposits as a further source of sediment potentially subject \nto resuspension. For this purpose, it was assumed that 5% of the deposited mass – representing the upper \nsurface layer – would be subject to resuspension. It should be noted that the model maintains a mass balance \nestimate of the remaining sediment of each size class within each grid cell to derive an estimate of the median \nparticle size in the surface-layer sediments. In turn, the potential for ongoing resuspension of fines is \ncalculated. In this way, the model represents the increased armouring of sediments as the average particle \nsize increases. \n--- Page 938 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 42 \nThe disposal time for the hopper material within each dredge cycle was assumed to be 20 minutes (Table 3.4). \nThe disposal location within the relevant spoil ground was varied for each dredge cycle in a randomised \nmanner, with the ultimate aim of ensuring an even distribution of dredged material within each spoil ground by \nthe conclusion of all activities (Table 3.5). \n \nAssumed PSDs of sediments initially suspended into the water column during TSHD \nhopper disposal operations at spoil grounds AB, 2B and 5A. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(µm) \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nDisposal – \nZone PRE2 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nDisposal – \nZone PRE3 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nDisposal – \nZone PRE4 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nDisposal – \nZone PRE6 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nDisposal – \nZone PRE8 \nPSD (%) for \nSediment \nDisposal – \nZone \nPRE10 \nClay \n<7 \n9.0 \n9.0 \n9.0 \n9.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n0.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(<KP30) \n6.9 \n(>KP30) \nFine Silt \n8-34 \n13.3 \n13.3 \n13.3 \n13.3 \n(<KP16.5) \n0.1 \n(>KP16.5) \n0.1 \n0.1 \n(<KP30) \n11.3 \n(>KP30) \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n15.3 \n15.3 \n15.3 \n15.3 \n(<KP16.5) \n3.5 \n(>KP16.5) \n3.5 \n3.5 \n(<KP30) \n13.4 \n(>KP30) \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n20.0 \n(<KP16.5) \n2.0 \n(>KP16.5) \n2.0 \n2.0 \n(<KP30) \n14.0 \n(>KP30) \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n42.4 \n42.4 \n42.4 \n42.4 \n(<KP16.5) \n94.4 \n(>KP16.5) \n94.4 \n94.4 \n(<KP30) \n54.4 \n(>KP30) \n \nAssumed vertical distribution of sediments initially suspended into the water column \nduring TSHD hopper disposal operations at spoil grounds AB, 2B and 5A. \nElevation \nExample Elevation (m ASB) – 20 m \nWater Depth and 12.75 m Hull Depth \nVertical Distribution (%) of \nSediments \nSurface/water depth \n20.0 \n5.0 \nHopper hull elevation \n7.5 \n10.0 \n0.75 x hull elevation \n5.6 \n20.0 \n0.50 x hull elevation \n3.8 \n30.0 \n0.25 x hull elevation \n1.9 \n35.0 \n \n \n--- Page 939 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 43 \n3.7.6 Representation of BHD Barge Tug/TSHD Propeller Wash \nModelling of sediment suspended by propeller-induced motion at the seabed was conducted to estimate likely \nsediment concentrations generated by the TSHD and harbour tug propellers while manoeuvring during \ndredging operations. A specialised numerical model developed by RPS, named PROPMAP, was used to \nestimate a time- and space-varying rate of sediment flux from the seabed due to the thrust imposed by each \nvessel’s propellers at the seabed level behind the moving vessel. The model uses characteristics of the vessel \nof interest to estimate the three-dimensional thrust-field generated by the propellers. This thrust-field is then \ncombined with the grain size and degree of cohesion of the seabed sediments, and the varying under-keel \nclearance along the typical vessel paths, to calculate variations in the suspended sediment flux from the \nseabed in time and space. \nThe following details were used as input to PROPMAP to calculate variable rates of sediment flux from the \nseabed due to propeller-wash effects: \n• \nVessel tracks and speeds; \n• \nVessel draft, engine power and propeller size; \n• \nBathymetry along the vessel tracks; \n• \nGrain size distributions of the sediment, defining the proportions of clay and silt along the vessel tracks. \nThe calculation steps applied by PROPMAP at discrete intervals along each vessel path were as follows: \n• \nBased on the vessel's engine power and propeller size, determine the propeller-induced velocity profile; \n• \nBased on the vessel's draft and the local bathymetry, determine the intersection of the thrust-field with \nthe seabed and find the thrust imposed on it; \n• \nBased on the velocity of water flow at the seabed, calculate the shear stress acting on it; \n• \nBased on the calculated shear stress, and the sediment grain size and cohesiveness, calculate a \ntheoretical erosion flux (mass per unit time) for seabed sediment. \nPropeller-induced velocity profiles were calculated using empirical expressions from Blaauw & van de Kaa \n(1978). Thrust at the seabed will depend upon the level of the bed, which will intersect as a plane (Figure 3.3). \nFor an under-keel clearance of 1 m, a velocity field exceeding 5 m/s would intersect the bed in this example, \nwhile at a clearance of 4 m the bed velocity would be reduced to <2 m/s. The influence of this thrust will vary \nwith the sediment grain size. Consequently, outcomes will be sensitive to the magnitude of the thrust, the \nunder-keel clearance and the PSD of the bed. \nSediment erosion flux was estimated from the derived velocity field using the empirical formulations of van Rijn \n(1989). The sediment flux component attributable to propeller wash was found to be depth-limited for areas \nwhere the under-keel clearance was less than 3 m, assuming a fully-loaded vessel (maximum draft). \nSimulations over deeper areas, including the areas where vessels would transit to the spoil grounds, indicated \nthat flux would be minimal (compared to other sources) and representative of short-lived suspension of the \nsurface-layer sediments followed by rapid settlement. This settlement time was estimated to be shorter than \nthe simulation output time-step. Propeller-wash was found to be more significant in the shallow areas and \nwould be greater over sediments previously suspended by dredging. \nThese findings were used to inform the definition of the sediment flux rates during TSHD dredging operations \n(see Section 3.7.4). \n \n \n--- Page 940 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 44 \n \nTwo-dimensional view of a propeller-induced velocity profile. \n \nIn summary, propeller-wash effects were considered: (i) along each pipeline section during dredging; (ii) \nbetween each pipeline section and the spoil grounds during dredging; and (iii) between borrow ground B and \neach pipeline section during backfilling. For borrow ground A, and the waters between it and the pipeline, \npropeller-wash effects are not relevant due to the greater water depths. \nIn the absence of definitive information relating to the seabed composition of the areas traversed by the barge \ntug or TSHD between the pipeline and the spoil grounds (or traversed by the TSHD between borrow ground \nB and the pipeline), for simplicity the seabed composition was assumed to be described by the PSD of the \narea from which the vessel began its journey. \n3.7.7 Representation of TSHD Backfill \nAll material dredged by the TSHD within the borrow grounds will be transported to sections POST2, POST4, \nPOST6, POST8 and POST10 of the pipeline route for placement. \nFor the backfill of the pipeline using unconsolidated sediments dredged by TSHD, the PSDs used in the model \nare based on PSDs from nearby boreholes (see Section 3.6). These PSDs are adjusted by removal of the \ncomponent treated as suspended during dredging within the borrow grounds (see Section 3.7.4), but as this \nrepresents only between 0.6% and 2.4% (averaged value depending on the relative contributions of overflow \nand non-overflow periods to the overall mass flux) of the mass for the minor components, the modified PSDs \nare not significantly different to the in situ PSDs (Table 3.31). It has been assumed, conservatively, that all \nsediment dredged from the borrow grounds is available for use as backfill material. \nOnce at the appropriate location, the TSHD suction pipe will discharge material at an elevation of \napproximately 5 m above the pipeline. Sediment release from the suction pipe will occur as a jet of slurry that \nwill have an initial rapid descent of solids followed by a billowing of lighter components back into the water \ncolumn after contact with the seabed/pipeline (Swanson et al., 2004). The plume that results from disposal of \na jet of slurry from a pipe is typically concentrated near the seabed, with most of the material within 3 m of the \n--- Page 941 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 45 \nbottom, and lower concentrations extend up towards the surface (Figure 3.4). Table 3.32 shows the assumed \nvertical distribution of the suspended material for the TSHD backfill source. \nIt is estimated that 95-99% of the bulk load deposits directly onto the seabed in a typical case, with the \nremainder released into the water column (CSMW, 2005, NEPA, 2001). It is difficult to find other definitive \nsource values in the literature, and no site-specific sampling has been conducted for TSHD backfill placement \noperations, but a value of 5% of each load agrees well with past experience and appears to be a conservative \nestimate based on the values quoted above.

Therefore, a conservative loss rate of \n5% of the total volume of dumped rock material was applied in the modelling. Based on material testing from \nprevious projects, the volume of quarried core/rock material less than 130 µm in size is typically even lower, \nin the order of 2%. Table 3.33 (equivalent to Table 3.16) presents the PSD that was applied in the modelling \nof the rock backfill source. The composition of the material is dominated by coarse sand and larger particles, \nwith the 2% of finer material assumed to be evenly spread over the four smaller material classes. Although \ncoarse sand material will be initially suspended in the water column, it will not be available for resuspension \nonce it settles. \nBecause the rock backfill material will be dumped from the deck of the vessel, it will move through the whole \nwater column as it falls to the seabed. Therefore, a uniform vertical distribution of suspended material in the \nwater column has been assumed (Table 3.34). \nThe placement time for the rock material within each cycle was assumed to be 120 minutes (Woodside, 2018a). \nOther than an increased placement time, the operational cycle is assumed to be equivalent to that for TSHD \nbackfill operations outlined in Table 3.6. \n \n \n--- Page 943 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 47 \nAssumed PSDs of sediments initially suspended into the water column during side-dump \nvessel backfill operations using material from an onshore quarry. \nSediment Grain \nSize Class \nSize Range \n(μm) \nPSD (%) for Rock Backfill \nClay \n<7 \n0.5 \nFine Silt \n7-34 \n0.5 \nCoarse Silt \n35-74 \n0.5 \nFine Sand \n75-130 \n0.5 \nCoarse Sand \n>130 \n98.0 \n \nAssumed vertical distribution of sediments initially suspended into the water column \nduring side-dump vessel backfill operations using material from an onshore quarry. \nElevation \nExample Elevation (m ASB) – 10 m \nWater Depth \nVertical Distribution (%) of \nSediments \nSurface/water depth \n10.0 \n20.0 \n0.8 x water depth \n8.0 \n20.0 \n0.6 x water depth \n6.0 \n20.0 \n0.4 x water depth \n4.0 \n20.0 \n0.2 x water depth \n2.0 \n20.0 \n \n3.7.9 Summary of Source Rates and Volumes \nFor each source of suspended sediment plumes during dredging, disposal and backfill operations, as \ndescribed in the preceding sections, Table 3.35 summaries the associated loss rates and approximate volumes \nof suspended sediment expected.

If all deposited material assumed to be available for potential resuspension following spoil \nground disposal operations is actually resuspended, a total of 339,076 m3 of sediment will be suspended in \nthe water column over the program duration; this will represent approximately 9.5% of the in situ dredged (and \nquarry) volume. \n \n \n--- Page 944 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 48 \nSummary of sediment sources applied in the model. \nPhase \nOperation \nSource Rate \n(% Production Rate) \nDredged Volume \n(m3) \nSuspended Volume \n(m3) \nPipeline dredging \nBHD excavator bucket \n2.1 \n51,147 \n215 \nBHD excavator bucket \n+ dewatering from \nbarge \n2.4 \n982 \nDisposal from hopper \nbarge \n5 (water column) \n5 (seabed; potential) \n2,557 \n2,557 \nTSHD drag-head + \npropeller-wash \n0.6 \n1,818,397 \n1,925 \nTSHD drag-head + \npropeller-wash + \noverflow \n2.4 \n35,940 \nDisposal from TSHD \n5 (water column) \n5 (seabed; potential) \n90,920 \n90,920 \nPipeline backfilling \nTSHD drag-head + \npropeller-wash \n0.6 \n1,608,095 \n2,783 \nTSHD drag-head + \npropeller-wash + \noverflow \n2.4 \n27,461 \nPlacement from TSHD \n5 \n80,405 \nPlacement from side-\ndump vessel \n5 \n73,426 \n3,671 \nTotals \n3,551,065 \n246,229 \n339,076 \n \n--- Page 945 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 49 \n4 \nENVIRONMENTAL THRESHOLD ANALYSIS \n4.1 \nOverview \nPredictions of SSC for each scenario were assessed against a series of water quality thresholds to categorise \nthe modelled outcomes into management zones of influence and impact, defined with regard to environmental \nsensitivities in the study region. These thresholds, and the technical justification which followed guidance from \nthe WAMSI Dredging Science Node, were supplied to RPS by Advisian (MScience, 2019). Thresholds were \nselected for benthic habitats on the basis of past and present mapping of communities in the project area. \nThresholds for three management zones – a Zone of Influence (ZoI), a Zone of Moderate Impact (ZoMI) and \na Zone of High Impact (ZoHI) – were defined. The criteria associated with each management zone also varied \nacross three ecological zones, which were broadly defined based on past studies of these areas. The \necological zones are named as follows, with reference to the pipeline chainages shown in Figure 1.1, and with \nthe spatial extents agreed for this study shown in Figure 4.1: \n• \nOffshore: the pipeline area beyond KP25, and generally all areas north of a boundary line containing \nRosemary Island, Legendre Island and Delambre Island. \n• \nZone B: the pipeline area between KP8 and KP25, adjacent coral and macroalgae habitats within Mermaid \nSound, and generally all coral, macroalgae and mixed community habitats between Dolphin Island and \nBezout Island. \n• \nZone A: the pipeline area between the shoreline and KP8, adjacent macroalgae and mangrove habitats \nwithin Mermaid Sound, and generally all mangrove, marsh and seagrass habitats between Nickol Bay \nand Point Samson. \nThresholds for coral habitats within Zone B were developed with the aid of data collected during a previous \ndredging campaign at Barrow Island, which is considered a similar habitat. Water quality within Zone A is more \nturbid, and coral communities are comprised of more sediment-tolerant or resilient species. Offshore habitats \nare not likely to contain corals. \nIn developing the thresholds, it was assumed that benthic communities around Spoil Ground 2B and Borrow \nGround A (see Figure 1.1) will be sparse and made up largely of sponges and filter feeders without corals. \n4.2 \nBaseline Water Quality \nWater quality data collected during the LNG Foundation Project over the period of 2007 to 2010 (MScience, \n2010) demonstrated that turbidity at sites within the Zone A and Zone B management areas was raised by \n0.7 NTU and 0.3 NTU, respectively, as a result of dredging activities. Subtraction of these dredge-induced \nvalues across the 2007-2010 data set yielded a set of baseline turbidity measurements. \nmeasurements in each zone. For the purposes of threshold assessment, it has been assumed that the summer \nseason comprises the period of November to March and the winter season contains the months of April to \nOctober. \n \n--- Page 946 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 50 \n \n \n \nDelineation of the proposed ecological zones (Zone A, Zone B and Offshore) in the context of known habitat areas and types.

This is generally considered equivalent to the area around \ndredging activities where a plume may be visible to the naked eye. \nThe ZoI threshold will be exceeded at any point within the model domain where dredging is forecast to increase \nthe depth-averaged concentration of SSC (specifically the contribution attributable to dredging activities) by a \nlevel greater than the seasonal 80th percentile baseline SSC over a 24-hour average period. \nappropriate for each ecological zone and month of the year was added to the dredge-induced SSC predictions \nfrom the sediment fate model prior to evaluation of the thresholds. \nPotential exceedances of the threshold were evaluated over the duration of each dredge scenario by \ncalculating a rolling 24-hour average of SSC concentrations in each model grid cell and checking for breaches \nas this time-window progressed through the data set at hourly increments (the temporal resolution of the data \nset). If the 24-hour average SSC concentration exceeds the threshold value at any time, even if only on one \noccasion, the model grid cell is included in the ZoI area. With each scenario spanning a period of ten months, \nZoI threshold checks were undertaken for more than 7,000 time steps. This approach allowed an increased \nopportunity to detect threshold exceedance events, compared with that afforded by the alternative method of \nsimply analysing each unique 24-hour sequence in turn (i.e. with no temporal overlap) from the start to the end \nof the data set. \nTypically, averaging discrete data points over an arbitrary time period will serve to reduce the influence of \ntransient spikes in concentration, thereby reducing the possibility of spurious exceedances. More rarely, a \ntransient concentration spike of sufficient magnitude to skew the rolling average to an above-threshold state \nmay result in exceedances being recorded for a longer period than will be the case in reality. Generally, \napplying a time-average to a data set for the purposes of threshold analysis will result in a smaller zone of \neffect than if instantaneous data is evaluated. This methodology also has a strong connection to critical \nexposure times for benthic habitats or species of concern in the project area. \n \n \n--- Page 948 ---\nREPORT \n \nMAW0753J  |  Scarborough Development Dredged Sediment Dispersion Modelling  |  Rev 4  |  07 June 2019 \nwww.rpsgroup.com/mst \nPage 52 \nBackground, dredge-excess and threshold SSC values used as the criteria to define the \nZoI outer boundary within each ecological zone. \nEcological Zone \nSeason \nTime-Averaged \nPeriod (hours) \nBackground SSC \n(mg/L) a \nDredge-Excess \nSSC (mg/L) b \nThreshold SSC \n(mg/L) c \nA \nSummer \n24 \n4.1 \n5.0 \n9.1 \nWinter \n24 \n1.8 \n2.3 \n4.1 \nB \nSummer \n24 \n2.5 \n2.7 \n5.2 \nWinter \n24 \n1.2 \n1.6 \n2.8 \nOffshore \nSummer \n24 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n3.6 \nWinter \n24 \n0.6 \n0.9 \n1.5 \na Background values are equivalent to ‘Mean SSC’ values in Table 4.1. \nb Dredge-excess values are equivalent to ‘80th Percentile SSC’ values in Table 4.1. \nc Threshold values are the sum of background and dredge-excess values. \n \n4.4 \nZone of Moderate Impact (ZoMI) \nThe ZoMI is defined as “a zone where impacts are sub-lethal or lethal but recoverable (in terms of the \ncommunity) within a five-year period” (MScience, 2019). \nThe ZoMI threshold will be exceeded at any point within the model domain where dredging is forecast to \nincrease the depth-averaged concentration of SSC to a level sufficient to trigger impacts to EC10 (10% Effect \nConcentration or 10% Inhibition) or to cause bleaching through loss of light or sedimentation. \nThresholds chosen to indicate a transition between the ZoI and ZoMI areas are largely based on the ‘possible \nmortality’ thresholds of Fisher et al. (2019). These thresholds are based on analysis of water quality and coral \nmonitoring data collected during a previous dredging project at Barrow Island, where coral communities exist \nin clear, near-oceanic conditions. Distinctions must be made between the thresholds most appropriate for each \necological zone. \nWithin the offshore zone, only thresholds of relevance to sponges and filter feeders are appropriate because \ncorals, seagrasses and macroalgae are not known to form significant communities. A threshold relating to an \nLC10 (10% Lethal Concentration) effect on filter feeder-sponge habitats over a 28-day exposure period was \nselected (Pineda et al., 2017). \nFor Zone B, coral communities experience similar conditions to those monitored at Barrow Island and the \nmoderate-impact thresholds of Fisher et al. (2019) for coral/mixed benthos communities were deemed to be \nappropriate (MScience, 2019). \nFor Zone A, coral communities experience more turbid conditions and are more tolerant of elevated SSC levels \nand lowered light levels than their neighbours in Zone B due to adaptation and a different mix of species. To \naccount for this greater tolerance, the moderate-impact thresholds in Zone A were defined as those of Zone B \nmultiplied by a factor of 1.5, which is believed to be a conservative multiplier (MScience, 2019). Within both \nZones A and B, spongers and filter feeders will occur among the corals, and the mixed community is best \nevaluated using coral-focused thresholds. \nThe taxa-specific thresholds and appropriate time-averaging periods (related to exposure times from \nexperimental data) used to define the extents of the ZoMI are detailed in Table 4.3.

Most material will initially be \nsuspended low in the water column, and material suspended higher in the water column will sink as it moves \naway from the source. Frequent resuspension of material will also mostly affect the lower reaches. Thus, the \nspatial area affected above a given concentration is typically greater in the near-seabed layer than in the near-\nsurface layer. It should be noted, however, that there are instances throughout the simulations where elevated \nconcentrations will occur in the near-surface layers – during TSHD overflow or split hopper barge dewatering \noperations, or during strong resuspension events affecting sediments that have migrated to shallow areas – \nbut these will typically not be sustained for extended periods of time. \nAlthough many of the activities related to dredging and backfilling of the pipeline will take place within Mermaid \nSound, which is dominated by tidal currents year-round and is relatively sheltered from the variations in large-\nscale circulation observed beyond approximately KP30, reasonably distinct seasonal trends are evident in the \nmodelling outcomes of each scenario. \nThe results observed on any given day will not always be representative of the given season’s prevailing \ntransport patterns, and plume concentrations and distributions are forecast to vary markedly. To explore this \nvariability, statistical distributions for each scenario are examined. Percentile distributions will summarise the \noutcomes over the entire scenario and do not represent an instantaneous plume footprint at any point in time. \nIn the scenarios where the inshore borrow ground is utilised, forecasts of median depth-averaged SSC \nconcentrations (values exceeded 50% of the time) for project works commencing in summer (Scenario 2B) \nwere in the range 0.1-1 mg/L over an area stretching from the south-western end of Angel Island to the waters \nbetween Enderby Island and West Intercourse Island. For project works commencing in winter (Scenario 1B), \nthe equivalent area is restricted to the waters between the inshore borrow ground and spoil ground AB. At the \n95th percentile (values exceeded only 5% of the time), forecasts of depth-averaged SSC concentrations 5 mg/L \nor greater in both seasons are found between Intercourse Island and the waters between the Malus Islands \nand Gidley Island (Scenario 1B, Figure 5.4; Scenario 2B, Figure 5.8). \nIn the scenarios where the offshore borrow ground is utilised, forecasts of 50th percentile (median) depth-\naveraged SSC concentrations do not exceed 0.1 mg/L for works commencing in either season. At the 95th \npercentile, forecasts of depth-averaged SSC concentrations 5 mg/L or greater are found in nearshore areas \nbetween Intercourse Island and King Bay for project works commencing in summer (Scenario 2A, Figure 5.6), \nand also near Angel Island and Conzinc Island for project works commencing in winter (Scenario 1A, Figure \n5.2). \nWhen examined over the course of an entire scenario, the sediment distributions reveal areas that broadly \nstraddle the dredging and disposal zones where recurrent elevations of near-seabed SSC are expected as a \nconsequence of dredging operations. The forecast in each scenario is that the greatest concentrations will \ntypically be found in the inshore waters of Mermaid Sound along the pipeline between the KP5 and KP25 \n--- Page 952 ---"
